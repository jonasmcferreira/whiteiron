# Lusitania

The basic idea is that of a Lusitanian mythology whose origin is almost divine. Camões took Luso as the supposed "father" of Lusitania. And since Luso is the son of Bacchus, it's easy to draw a line between Lusitanian mythology and Greek mythology. Which is good for me because it allows me to wear the "sword and sandal" or peplum elements that I like so much. Here is an outline of the origins of Lusitania. The text is not final.

THE ORIGINS OF LUSITANIA
The Lusitanians are the bravest of all the tribes. Their origins go back to the great Luso, son of Bacchus, who with his companions arrived from the far east, crossing the Columns of Hercules at the entrance to the Mediterranean. In the wild lands from the Dubro to the River Tago, there were scattered tribes of shepherds and hunters who, at great cost, survived in a constant struggle against the hordes of Ophidians, repellent serpentine creatures who worshipped strange chthonic gods.
Luso organized the tribes of the region. He taught them many things, but above all, how to fight the threat of the Ophidians. Luso pushed them into the bowels of the earth, whose cavernous entrances were sealed with huge boulders. When the land was appeased, he ordered the construction of the Castro do Cântaro Magro, high up in the Serra da Estrela. There, in the largest of all the castros, the Lusitanians worship Endovelicus, the most important of all the Lusitanian gods.
When Luso left Lusitania, he left Pá to rule as his representative.

THE PHOENICIANS AND THE GREEKS
At that time, the first Phoenician ships arrived and dropped anchor at the mouth of the River
Tago, where they founded the colony of Allis Ubbo. Enterprising, the Phoenicians soon began trading with the Lusitanians and Allis Ubbo grew from a small colony to the largest city in the region. The place was blessed by Návial whose daughters, the Tágides, protected the waters and the ships that arrived and set sail. The Greeks arrived later and settled further north, in Phókia, bringing with them textiles, jewelry, amphorae and objects of adornment.
