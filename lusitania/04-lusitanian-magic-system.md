# Magic System

Lusitatian magic could be heavily tied to the natural world, reflecting the Lusitanians' reverence for nature and the elements. Here are some elements you could include:

- **Elemental Magic:** The ability to control and manipulate the elements (earth, air, fire, water).
- **Druidic Magic:** Magic that involves communicating with and influencing the natural world, including plants, animals, and weather.
- **Divination:** The ability to predict the future or gain insight into a question or situation.
- **Healing Magic:** The ability to heal injuries and cure illnesses.
- **Rune Magic:** The use of ancient runes to cast spells or create magical effects.
