Likewise, if there's no way anyone could accomplish the task, just tell the player it doesn't work.</p> <p>Otherwise, answer these three simple questions:</p> <ul> <li>What kind of ability check?</li> <li>How hard is it?</li> <li>What's the result?</li> </ul> <p>Use the descriptions of the ability scores and their associated skills in the rulebook to help you decide what kind of ability check to use.

The easiest way to set a DC is to decide whether the task's difficulty is easy, moderate, or hard, and use these three DCs:</p> <ul> <li>Easy (DC 10). An easy task requires a minimal level of competence or a modicum of luck to accomplish.</li> <li>Moderate (DC 15). A moderate task requires a slightly higher level of competence to accomplish.

For example, an NPC might stabilize a dying character, guard a prisoner, or help barricade a door.</li> <li>If an NPC contributes greatly to the party's success in a battle, the NPC should receive an equal share of the XP earned for the encounter.

The town is known for its excellent quality stone and gems, making it a valuable settlement for obtaining mined materials.</p> <p>A unique agreement exists in Duren Thol: whenever a resident dies or reaches the end of their life, they are offered the chance to be converted into an undead worker, a practice regarded with honor and respect. These undead workers are called The Volunteers by the townsfolk, a title that reflects both reverence and practicality.</p> <p>The constant patrolling and laboring of these Volunteers contribute to the town's smooth functioning. However, it is obvious to any observer that a necromancer is present in the village, though their identity remains a mystery. The inhabitants understand that uncovering and eliminating the necromancer would be detrimental, as the undead workers kept underground would turn on the town. Thus, the necromancer's presence is tacitly accepted, and the town continues to run efficiently under this dark yet effective system.</p> <p>Necromancer (unknown) - controls undead, but lost in Jhed Wasteland Fizwidget - gnome inventor, crafter of The Gliding Cloud.

Here are some specific strategies for using the different types of monsters in your campaign</p>"},{"location":"jhed-wasteland/monter-types/#undead_1","title":"Undead","text":"<p>Ambush and Attrition* - Use undead to create relentless, attrition-based encounters. For example, after the party defeats a wave of zombies, a second wave of skeletons might rise from the frozen ground, forcing the party to conserve resources and think strategically. - Incorporate undead as environmental hazards. Perhaps a path through a graveyard is littered with dormant skeletons that will only rise if disturbed, adding tension as the players carefully navigate the area.</p> <p>Moral Dilemmas* - In Dhuren Tol, undead are used as laborers. The party might encounter situations where they must decide whether to destroy these creatures, knowing they are essential to the village's survival, or find a way to free them from their curse.</p>"},{"location":"jhed-wasteland/monter-types/#beasts_1","title":"Beasts","text":"<p>Survival and Hunting* - Use beasts to reinforce the harshness of Jhed's environment. A pack of wolves might trail the party, attacking only when they sense weakness, forcing the players to stay vigilant during their travels. - Introduce hunting mechanics where the party must track and take down a large beast like a mammoth or sabertooth tiger to gather resources or complete a quest. The success or failure of this hunt could have lasting consequences.</p> <p>Natural Obstacles* - Beasts can also serve as obstacles rather than direct threats. For instance, a slumbering giant sloth might block a crucial path, requiring the party to either find a way around it or risk waking it up.</p>"},{"location":"jhed-wasteland/monter-types/#giants_1","title":"Giants","text":"<p>Environmental Control* - Giants can dramatically alter the battlefield. A hill giant in Netrus might hurl boulders that create difficult terrain, forcing the party to adapt their tactics. - Cloud giants in the Frozen Storm Forest could summon storms or manipulate the weather to their advantage, making ranged combat more difficult and forcing the party to engage in close quarters.</p> <p>Allies and Enemies* - Giants can be both foes and allies. A cyclops might be a neutral force, offering aid in exchange for a favor, or a powerful enemy that the party must outwit rather than overpower.</p>"},{"location":"jhed-wasteland/monter-types/#humanoids_1","title":"Humanoids","text":"<p>Social Dynamics* - Use humanoid tribes like Orcs, Goliaths, and Kobolds to create social encounters where diplomacy, intimidation, or trickery might be more effective than combat. For example, a Goliath chieftain might challenge the party to a contest of strength rather than a battle. - The presence of lycanthropes adds a layer of mystery and paranoia. The party might need to uncover which NPCs are secretly werecreatures, adding a detective element to the campaign.</p> <p>Resource Management* - Humanoids like the Aarakocra or Yuan-ti could control valuable resources, such as safe passage through Roc-infested skies or access to a hidden temple. The party might need to negotiate, steal, or fight for these resources.</p>"},{"location":"jhed-wasteland/monter-types/#biome-related-monsters_1","title":"Biome-Related Monsters","text":"<p>Environmental Storytelling* - Myconids in Oravilla can be used to create eerie, atmospheric encounters where the very land seems alive. The party might stumble upon a Myconid colony, where they must navigate through spore-filled air and negotiate with the sentient fungi. - Azer in Dhuren Tol could introduce elements of fire and heat in an otherwise frozen landscape, providing a stark contrast and unique challenges like melting ice bridges or evaporating water sources.</p> <p>Surprise and Ambush* - Roc patrols can be used to create high-stakes encounters where the party must either hide from these massive birds or face the consequences of being spotted. - Behirs and Bulettes offer opportunities for sudden, underground attacks, where the ground beneath the party\u2019s feet is just as dangerous as the creatures themselves.</p>"},{"location":"jhed-wasteland/monter-types/#rare-and-very-rare-monsters","title":"Rare and Very Rare Monsters","text":"<p>Epic Moments* - Use creatures like the Deep Gem Dragon or Aboleth to create pivotal story moments. These rare monsters should be tied to major plot developments, such as uncovering ancient secrets or challenging the party\u2019s moral compass. - A Couatl might appear to guide the party through a particularly dangerous area, offering wisdom or a riddle that hints at the solution to a larger mystery.</p> <p>Plot Catalysts* - Rare creatures like Rakshasas or Mariliths can serve as the masterminds behind complex plots, manipulating events from the shadows. Defeating these fiends could be the culmination of a long campaign arc, where the party uncovers and dismantles their schemes piece by piece.</p>"},{"location":"jhed-wasteland/monter-types/#dynamic-encounters","title":"Dynamic Encounters","text":"<p>Layered Challenges* - Combine different monster types to create multi-faceted encounters. For instance, a battle against a group of Kobolds could be complicated by the sudden appearance of a Bulette, turning a straightforward fight into a chaotic free-for-all. - Use the environment to add complexity to encounters. A fight against undead in a crumbling ruin could be punctuated by collapsing floors or the release of poisonous gas, forcing the party to constantly adapt.</p> <p>Unexpected Twists* - Introduce encounters where the monsters\u2019 actions are driven by more than just combat. Perhaps a group of Lizardfolk is in the middle of a ritual when the party arrives\u2014do they intervene, observe, or try to communicate? - Create encounters where the outcome isn\u2019t just about victory or defeat. A Roc might capture a party member and carry them off to its nest, triggering a rescue mission rather than a traditional battle.</p> <p>By using these strategies, you can turn the monsters of Jhed into more than just obstacles.

This land stretches endlessly with an expanse of ice, a frozen desert as vast as Antarctica. Here, the cold is your constant companion, and the wind howls with the voices of ancient spirits. The Jhed Wastelands are a realm of stark beauty and hidden peril, where only the strongest survive and the boldest thrive.</p> <p></p> <p>Imagine a world where the horizon is an unbroken line of white, where snow and ice dominate the landscape, and the ground beneath your feet is perpetually frozen. Towering glaciers, like ancient titans, loom over the landscape, their jagged peaks piercing the sky. These massive ice formations move imperceptibly, carving out valleys and creating sheer cliffs of ice, constantly reminding you of nature's raw, unyielding power.</p> <p>Between these icy giants lie vast fields of snow and ice, seemingly endless and uniform, yet treacherous in their own right. The ice fields can be deceptively smooth, hiding deep crevasses that can swallow the unwary traveler whole. In some areas, the wind shapes the snow into dunes, creating a frozen version of a desert's shifting sands. These snow dunes can be several feet high, making travel slow and arduous.</p> <p>Elsewhere, frost plains stretch out, flat and featureless, their surfaces glittering like fields of diamonds under the pale sunlight. These plains are often scoured by icy winds, making them some of the coldest and most inhospitable parts of the wastelands. Beneath the surface lies the permafrost, a layer of soil that remains frozen year-round. This permafrost can be incredibly thick, extending hundreds of feet below the surface. It prevents most plant life from taking root, contributing to the barren appearance of the wastelands. However, it also conceals hidden hazards\u2014pockets of methane gas that can ignite explosively, and ancient ice that can crack and shift without warning.</p> <p>Above this frozen landscape, the aurora borealis dances across the night sky, painting it with vivid hues of green, purple, and blue. These northern lights are a breathtaking sight, a beautiful contrast to the bleakness below. Steeped in legend, some say the auroras are the spirits of ancient warriors, guiding travelers with their ethereal light, while others believe they are a manifestation of powerful arcane energies, hinting at the magic that still lingers in the land.</p> <p>Interspersed throughout the Jhed Wastelands are frozen lakes and icebound rivers, their surfaces hard and unyielding. These bodies of water, locked in ice, are often covered by thick snow, making them difficult to distinguish from the surrounding terrain. Beneath the ice, some lakes still hold liquid water, kept from freezing solid by geothermal heat or arcane phenomena. These hidden reservoirs are vital sources of water for the inhabitants of the wastelands, though accessing them can be perilous.</p> <p>The soundscape of the Jhed Wastelands is as unique as its visual panorama. The creaking and groaning of shifting ice is a constant background noise, punctuated by the howling wind and the occasional distant roar of a collapsing glacier. In the stillness of the coldest nights, one might hear the faint cracking of the ice underfoot, a subtle yet ominous reminder of the land's inherent dangers.</p> <p>Hidden among the glaciers and ice fields are remote valleys and ice caves, offering a brief respite from the harsh elements. These natural shelters can be crucial for survival, providing protection from the wind and a place to set up camp. Some of these caves are simple hollows in the ice, while others are intricate networks of tunnels, possibly formed by ancient lava flows or carved out by subterranean rivers. They can be awe-inspiring, with walls of translucent blue ice and ceilings adorned with icicles.</p> <p>Due to its extreme latitude, the Jhed Wastelands experience prolonged periods of twilight, where the sun barely rises above the horizon, casting a perpetual twilight over the land. This creates an eerie, otherworldly atmosphere, with long shadows and a sky that transitions through shades of deep blue and purple. The lack of clear daylight can be disorienting, making navigation even more challenging and contributing to the land's reputation as an endless, desolate wilderness.</p>"},{"location":"jhed-wasteland/setting/#unexplored-and-not-a-globe-player-handout","title":"Unexplored and Not a Globe (player handout)","text":"<p>The universe that J'hed exists in is not a globe, there are many postulations but as J'hed is unmapped it remains heated debate.
