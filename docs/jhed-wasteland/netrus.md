# Netrus Village

Breaking the snowdrift is a constant plume of smoke, a village teetering at the cliffs to overlook the J'hed Bay. The left, a lonely stone spire jutting towards the expanse. Then a collection of dark wooden longhouses flickering a dim glow of business and respite. The closest structure, a modest two story watch tower signalling your presence has been noticed.

## Features

### Grey Spire

A grey spire is the main feature of Netrus at one end of this horseshoe shaped village. Naturally formed on one half with snow clinging like moss; the rest cleft by stonework turned to brick, for a circular platform. Harsh winds keep the snow from settling on the smooth cut stone at the arched passage, none but Nick Elder enter. Deep groves crafted to Arcane Sigils adorn this place, different others found in Netrus. The Grey Spire watches over the expanse of J'hed, tips of mountains lapeaking aabove a heavy fog 

The glyphs of Grey Spire appear to be difficult to decypher but they are clearly there to ward away the unwanted

### Unlit Pyre
Nestled in the center is a large unlit pyre, clearly of ceremonial purpose but not used in some time. Placed upon the stones around are silver coins, and as each resident of Netrus passes, they add another coin.

### Sisters Home
A two story darkwood longhome sits at the other end of the horseshoe. An inviting plume of smoke, as the cracks in the structure flicker with firelight, clearly the heart of this small community. Carvings with a dim glow on the side of the building and doors sized for giants, with two smaller rounded huts attached at the side.

The smell of smoked meat fills the air, the chants and cheers as bone cups clatter and slosh a wonderful contrast to the bleak climate. Hung from the fur thatched roof, dried game casting dancing shadows as they sway. Three strikingly beautiful women serve and cook the patrons in this open hall from a few large simmering cauldrons. Tired and accomplished denizens sleeping on the floor, slumped drink, boasting of their hunts. 

As anyone enters everyone raises their cup and yell "To the South, we drink today"

### Chapel of Worship
A thin stave church-like building with three floors is near the Unlit Pyre. A dim but constant glow emminating an intense warmth for both the body and spirit. This humble darkwood structure is near empty, makeshift shrines scattered about, only what is needed. Sammul is found there to converse, it is a private space for those to reflect on the realities of these southlands in the comfort of a guiding faith

### Watch Tower

The first building in Netrus is 30ft high wooden watchtower. Three guards rotating and greeting travellers and denizens, notififying the village of arrivals and prepared to aid as any journey into J'hed is dangerous and with peril. It would not be able to survive any meaningful seige

    **suggested

### "Nick" Ugris, Head of Netrus

**Stats**: Hill Giant/Storm Giant, **Language**: Giant **Goal**: Keep Netrus Safe, **Weakness**: Rules only by force

Often found outside, "Giant Home" the spire in Netrus to overlook the wasteland and village. A scraggly Giant covered in whisping white hairs from all parts of his body, at a glance almost looking like a yeti. Lumbering around, fishing and sharing stories. 

Nick does not interfere until he is asked with village disputes, but his decisions aren't questioned. The first time someone may act against Netrus he will simply warn the offender, next is exile and the hospitality of Netrus is gone. Any other acts against Netrus will make Nick hostile

Nick will not leave the village for more than a few hours, believing Netrus will be attacked if it loses his protection (he is right)

**Special Rewards**: Hill Giant Belt, and the ability to improve it up qualities

**Revelation**: Nick Ugris is under a madness making him more socialable and desiring to protect Netrus, while making him act more as a Hill Giant, if his Madness is removed he will return to a home in the clouds above Jhed 

### Three Sisters - Ulga Elga Alga - Potion Makers

    Ulga, Elga, Ylga 
    
**Stats**: Green Hag/Night Hag/Sea Hag, **Language**: Giant **Goal**: Aid those loyal to Netrus, **Weakness**: They are together, and if any goes missing they can't function

Ulga speaks of tragedy, stories and wanting to know the struggles the travelers have seen. Appears as a young extremely attractive woman.

Elga speaks of dreams and visions, curious to know what ethereal images travelers have seen. Appears as a middle aged extremely attractive woman

Ylga speaks of beauty and ugliness, wanting to know what everyone finds precious or ugly. Appears as an ugly young woman

If any of the three are removed or killed, they will give the party a quest to find another Potion brewer (hag), if two go missing and die the final one will flee

**Potions**: Once per long rest the party will given 1 potion before they head out if they don't have one (they do this for the entire village)

**Upgrade**: Town size must increase to get increase in potion power (more adventurers), Frostberries and Oozes are important reagents for making new potion types

**Revelation**: Hags Coven, that will begin poisoning everyone if their madness is cured, and then leave. They are aware they are hags.

### Sammul Faithful

**Stats**: priest, **Language**: common  **Goal**: Deepen the faith of any wanderer, **Weakness**: Curious to Gods that easily corrupt

**Service:** Remove Curse - 300gs, Auguary 225gps, Cure Wounds 50gps (once a week)

Sammul Faithful has red runes etched to his shell and the form of a snapping tortle. Spending his time sharing stories and guiding anyone through a crisis of faith or identity. Often he is the first chosen to handle disputes before it gets to Nick. 

Sammul has no specific faith, but emboldens the faith of those around him good or bad. He should be knowledgable of Religious history

Sammul can cast a 3rd level spell which should be notable

Due to Sammual being eager and enthusiastic he is helpful but easily corrupted

Each day something of value is thrown off the cliff as a sacrifice to the various gods

The runes around the town are Explosive Glyphs crafted by Sammul, and he makes a new one each week

**Madness**: Sammul's friendly demeanor is a fault of a madness, if removed he will revert back to a cultist

**Code of Snow:** Sammul the religious leader of Netrus will explain to the party that though their task is lawful, Jhed is a place of new beginnings and that actions taken before someone has reached Jhed are not held against their character. The village of Netrus will even offer the gold reward of the bounty to ignore it.

**Bounty Hunters:** Though bounty hunters act within the law, they are despised by the population of Jhed, disputes should be handled personally. This makes Jhed a home for new beginnings of shady characters

### Dizrim Headhunter (Bounty Hunter - Outer Regions)

**Stats**: veteran, **Language**: common,gnome  **Goal**: Collect Bounties, **Weakness**: Wants friendship, lonely

    Socially outcast due to the nature of the Code of Snow, but is dutiful in the works with Southpost. Dead or Alive bounties are plentiful, though most dead. Dizrim's hut is just outside Netrus proper and most parties spit past her home as they head out. Dizrim is lonely and will do many things to gain friendship, but she will abide her work

**Quests** see independent factions

### Mallun BlackAle

**Stats**: veteran, **Language**: common,dwarf  **Goal**: Collect weapons, **Weakness**: gambler


### Oniteth "Adventurer's Inc."

Should look like a Southport guard

**Stats**: Oni, **Language**: common,giant  **Goal**: hunting for fun, **Weakness**: 

### Founding Reasons

    - Northmost tradepost in the Jhed Continent
    - Thief Twin Kings created underground smuggling route from Thieves Key to Netrus
    - Water around Netrus contain intense arcane traces, perfect potion brewing

### Oddities

    - stone's/glyphs of warding everywhere in Netrus
    - charmed when entering, assumed to be from a glyph, hidden truth: relic village is built over
    - fighting arena for disputes/fun/gambling outside of charmed region

### Beasts of Burden info

    - glacial bears, arctic wolves, sabertooths, Vegetarian animal?

### Law

    - Seat of Jhed taxes Netrus, the amount is never set.
    - Most disputes are settled through Sammul, else Nick is the final decision
    - The denizens of Netrus don't care about affairs outside of Netrus that don't directly involve them
    - Outside of outward hostility, and theft Netrus only cares about protection of the village

### Food

    - fish and meat in abundance

### Allies, Enemies and Neutral

    - The villagers ask nothing of the party while offering potions, food, and lodging at no cost
    - If the party helps through tasks, donations and protection; this improves the quality and value of these offers
    - Acting against Netrus will come as three warnings, the first being a loss of free support, then exile, and then open hostility on the Jhed Continent

### Expansion and Loss

    - If the population of Netrus shrinks below 10, the village risks total failure and needs the parties help
    - Securing the trade route to the Keys is the best way to expand the population of Jhed while sending out valuable items to begin a gold rush
    - If the village expands it won't all be under the effects of the charm, and Nick won't have enough power to control through force. This will limit potion supply but increase options

## Boons and Banes

### Boon

Growth - at population 30 there will be a conflict to the rule of Netrus

### Bane

Food Shortage - requires to hire hunting party (3) 1000gp from Thieves Key, or 3000gp from Outer Empire

Criminals - items start going missing

Outer Empire - an extra tax

### Hidden Arcane Complex

Underneath Netrus is a small arcane chamber with an Ancient Relic. The glyphs and design of the sanctum reverse the magical emminations, specifically designed and attuned to this stone. This stone is the reason everyone in Netrus is charmed as the stones orginal purpose creates a madness of violence. If this chamber is destroyed, all creatures will become hostile to eachother in Netrus

## Events

    Dead Villager - Netrus is shrinking and they need more denizens, good to tie in with Oniteth's Aventuring group so she comes across as incompetent

    "Volunteers" - arrive

## Siege of Netrus
  
    Nick Elder believes there will be a takeover of Netrus and wishes to bolster the defenses. Suggesting to chat with the giants and other kin around to see who will join the ranks to defend against the assault. Netrus is a desired location regardless of it's seemingly unimpressive value, and the party will either sway allies to help or create new enemies to assist the Siege; the real treasure is the Arcane Chamber beneath


    There is no set time for this attack, but it should happen when players are level 4, the siege should happen over 4 days and players should be rewarded for organizing and suggesting styles of defenses: walls/trenches, pallicades, extra forces

    The players could also betray netrus, learning of the Arcane Chamber and using it to their own ends
