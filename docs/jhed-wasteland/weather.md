# J'hed Weather 380

The campaign of Jhed should focus heavily on weather, emphasizing how taxing on resources and time dealing with the intense and arcane weather can be. The weather changes quickly represented by rolling on a weather table after each short or long rest. A party should be considering how to engage a problem or delay or speed up their plans based on the weather.

Weather in Jhed is an entity and every time that there is a need to travel, or if the characters stay unsheltered somewhere longer than a few hours, then we must roll on the weather table.
Depending on the roll, different events will happen

The party can choose to **Shelter** the weather effects


## Shelter

Sheltering in place represents the party taking a short rest (8 hours) and waiting for the weather to improve. The DM may decide that no viable shelter is available, but it’s advised to use this sparingly, as the weather itself represents large spans of time passing (8–16 hours), and denying shelter could lead to overly punishing conditions.

**Roll on the shelter table for effects:**

When Sheltering each player rolls individually on the chart after the Short Rest is completed.

| D12 Roll | Result                                             |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------|
| 1        | Gain 1 level of Exhaustion                         |
| 2        | Short Rest cannot be completed                     |
| 3        | lose all temporary HP at the end of the Short Rest |
| 4        | Take 3 cold damage                                 |
| 5        | Expend one spell slot or hit die with no effect    |
| 6        | Consume double rations                             |
| 7        | Take 1 cold damage                                 |
| 8        | lose Inspiration die at the end of the Short Rest  |
| 9        | ---                                                |
| 10       | ---                                                |
| 11       | Gain 1d4 Temporary Hit Points                      |
| 12       | Gain an Inspiration Die                            |

Keep in mind these Short Rests are designed to be overall punishing to reinforce that traveling in J'hed isn't safe and with enough time most things should perish or go mad. If the players manage to find a comfortable place to rest, consider letting them roll 2d12 picking the highest roll.

## Weather

The results of the weather table should always be considered as the cumulative effect of traveling. If a character was to take Bludgeoning Damage; it isn't from one Giant rock falling (could be), but from 8 to 16 hours of traversing through the J'hed wilderness

Always add previous effects
