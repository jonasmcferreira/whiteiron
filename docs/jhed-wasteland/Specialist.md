## Specialist

*Subtlety with a bang*

There are a few Rogues that venture to the J'hed wilds that focus more on the element of surprise, the surprise of what concoctions they have built. These Specialist Rogues create their opportunities with a bit of a bang

### Level 3: Spcialist's Toolkit
The following items are considered part of the **Specialist's Toolkit**: Acid, Alchemist's Fire, Holy Water, Serpent Venom, Bomb
		
When you use any items of the Specialist Toolkit you can gain any of the following adjustments(can select more than one):
- Target one creature or object you can see within 20 feet of yourself
- The saving throw becomes a Dexterity save (DC = 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and your proficiency bonus).
- If the target fails the saving throw, you may apply your Sneak Attack damage to it (still once per turn limit).
- Once per turn if the target succeeds the saving throw, you may make one attack against the target
	
When you complete a Long Rest you can create one of each item in your Specialist Toolkit, these items lose their effectiveness and become inhert after 24 hours.
	
	
### Level 9: A little more potent
When you use an item from the Specialist's Toolkit you may apply one of the following benefits
- Double the damage die (including Sneak Attack)
- Increase the radius by 5ft
- Increase the range by 30ft
	
Once you use each of these abilities you must complete a Short Rest or Long Rest before selecting the option again
	
The following items are considered part of the **Specialist's Toolkit**: Dynamite, Frag Grenade, Smoke Grenade, Malice (Poison)
	
### Level 13: Useful mixtures
gain resistance to acid and poison damage

after you finish a Long rest you can create up to a number of common or uncommon potions equal to your proficiency modifer. These potions lose their effectiveness after 24 hours
		
### level 17: "The Big One"
The following item is considered part of the **Specialist's Toolkit** "The Big One"

Once Per Long Rest as an action, you can light a "The Big One" and throw it at a point up to 60 feet away, where it explodes. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius Sphere centered on that point must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and Proficiency Bonus) taking 10d8 Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. "The Big One" disintigrates all non-magic material and leaves behind an anti-magic zone of the same radius
	
It takes 1 minute to rig "The Big One" with a longer fuse so it explodes after a longer period of time, such as 1 minute or 10 minutes.
	
If you drop to 0HP or die, you may trigger The Big One targetting yourself, even if it has been used
