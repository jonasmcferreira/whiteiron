# Monster Types in Jhed

Keep an idea of what monsters we are using and where

Jhed is a land of harsh climates, ancient mysteries, and forgotten powers, and the monsters that roam this wasteland reflect that grim reality. The creatures found here are not just obstaclesâ€”they are part of the living, breathing ecosystem of Jhed, each with its own role to play in the narrative you weave as a Dungeon Master. This guide provides an overview of the most common monster types found in Jhed, along with tips on how to effectively use them in your campaign.

## Expected Encounters

The monsters in Jhed are as varied as the land itself. From undead laborers to ancient giants, these creatures are tailored to the environment, creating unique challenges for your players. The following categories highlight the types of encounters your players might face, along with some suggestions on how to make these encounters memorable.

### Undead

The undead are a common sight in Jhed, particularly in the village of Dhuren Tol, where they are often used as laborers. These creatures range from the mindless workers that serve the living to more malevolent spirits that haunt the land. As a Dungeon Master, you can use the undead to create a sense of unease and dread, reminding players that death is never far away in Jhed.

## How to Use These Monsters

The creatures of Jhed are more than just enemies to be defeated; they are tools to shape the narrative, enhance the atmosphere, and challenge your players in unique ways. Here are some specific strategies for using the different types of monsters in your campaign

### Undead

Ambush and Attrition*
- Use undead to create relentless, attrition-based encounters. For example, after the party defeats a wave of zombies, a second wave of skeletons might rise from the frozen ground, forcing the party to conserve resources and think strategically.
- Incorporate undead as environmental hazards. Perhaps a path through a graveyard is littered with dormant skeletons that will only rise if disturbed, adding tension as the players carefully navigate the area.

Moral Dilemmas*
- In Dhuren Tol, undead are used as laborers. The party might encounter situations where they must decide whether to destroy these creatures, knowing they are essential to the village's survival, or find a way to free them from their curse.

### Beasts

Survival and Hunting*
- Use beasts to reinforce the harshness of Jhed's environment. A pack of wolves might trail the party, attacking only when they sense weakness, forcing the players to stay vigilant during their travels.
- Introduce hunting mechanics where the party must track and take down a large beast like a mammoth or sabertooth tiger to gather resources or complete a quest. The success or failure of this hunt could have lasting consequences.

Natural Obstacles*
- Beasts can also serve as obstacles rather than direct threats. For instance, a slumbering giant sloth might block a crucial path, requiring the party to either find a way around it or risk waking it up.

### Giants

Environmental Control*
- Giants can dramatically alter the battlefield. A hill giant in Netrus might hurl boulders that create difficult terrain, forcing the party to adapt their tactics.
- Cloud giants in the Frozen Storm Forest could summon storms or manipulate the weather to their advantage, making ranged combat more difficult and forcing the party to engage in close quarters.

Allies and Enemies*
- Giants can be both foes and allies. A cyclops might be a neutral force, offering aid in exchange for a favor, or a powerful enemy that the party must outwit rather than overpower.

### Humanoids

Social Dynamics*
- Use humanoid tribes like Orcs, Goliaths, and Kobolds to create social encounters where diplomacy, intimidation, or trickery might be more effective than combat. For example, a Goliath chieftain might challenge the party to a contest of strength rather than a battle.
- The presence of lycanthropes adds a layer of mystery and paranoia. The party might need to uncover which NPCs are secretly werecreatures, adding a detective element to the campaign.

Resource Management*
- Humanoids like the Aarakocra or Yuan-ti could control valuable resources, such as safe passage through Roc-infested skies or access to a hidden temple. The party might need to negotiate, steal, or fight for these resources.

### Biome-Related Monsters

Environmental Storytelling*
- Myconids in Oravilla can be used to create eerie, atmospheric encounters where the very land seems alive. The party might stumble upon a Myconid colony, where they must navigate through spore-filled air and negotiate with the sentient fungi.
- Azer in Dhuren Tol could introduce elements of fire and heat in an otherwise frozen landscape, providing a stark contrast and unique challenges like melting ice bridges or evaporating water sources.

Surprise and Ambush*
- Roc patrols can be used to create high-stakes encounters where the party must either hide from these massive birds or face the consequences of being spotted.
- Behirs and Bulettes offer opportunities for sudden, underground attacks, where the ground beneath the partyâ€™s feet is just as dangerous as the creatures themselves.

### Rare and Very Rare Monsters

Epic Moments*
- Use creatures like the Deep Gem Dragon or Aboleth to create pivotal story moments. These rare monsters should be tied to major plot developments, such as uncovering ancient secrets or challenging the partyâ€™s moral compass.
- A Couatl might appear to guide the party through a particularly dangerous area, offering wisdom or a riddle that hints at the solution to a larger mystery.

Plot Catalysts*
- Rare creatures like Rakshasas or Mariliths can serve as the masterminds behind complex plots, manipulating events from the shadows. Defeating these fiends could be the culmination of a long campaign arc, where the party uncovers and dismantles their schemes piece by piece.

### Dynamic Encounters

Layered Challenges*
- Combine different monster types to create multi-faceted encounters. For instance, a battle against a group of Kobolds could be complicated by the sudden appearance of a Bulette, turning a straightforward fight into a chaotic free-for-all.
- Use the environment to add complexity to encounters. A fight against undead in a crumbling ruin could be punctuated by collapsing floors or the release of poisonous gas, forcing the party to constantly adapt.

Unexpected Twists*
- Introduce encounters where the monstersâ€™ actions are driven by more than just combat. Perhaps a group of Lizardfolk is in the middle of a ritual when the party arrivesâ€”do they intervene, observe, or try to communicate?
- Create encounters where the outcome isnâ€™t just about victory or defeat. A Roc might capture a party member and carry them off to its nest, triggering a rescue mission rather than a traditional battle.

By using these strategies, you can turn the monsters of Jhed into more than just obstacles. They become integral parts of the world, each encounter a story in itself that contributes to the larger narrative of your campaign.
