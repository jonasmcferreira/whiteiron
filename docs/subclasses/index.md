# SubClasses

Here you'll find all our homebrew subclasses — tested in the cold, balanced through play, and built with narrative in mind.

Each subclass includes:

- Flavor text and theme
- Mechanical breakdown (features per level)
- Playtest notes and changelogs

## Barbarian Subclasses

[Path of the Breaker](path-of-the-breaker.md) - A wild, improvised warrior who turns debris into devastation. Anything can be a weapon — especially when rage fuels creativity. Smash magic items, hurl allies, and reduce the battlefield to rubble.

## Fighter Subclasses

[Wrangler subclass](wrangler.md) - A battlefield controller who uses nets, chains, and tethers to dominate the battlefield and protect allies.
