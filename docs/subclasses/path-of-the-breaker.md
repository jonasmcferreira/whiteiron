# Path of the Breaker

*Everything is a weapon.*

Barbarians that take the Path of the Breaker are never without the tools to fight. If it is not nailed down — and in many cases, even if it is — there will be a continued onslaught of debris. This is a path where rage subsides only when there is nothing left to throw.

The J'hed wilderness requires the ability to fight when provisions run low to survive; to rely on a weapon is just another weakness.

### Level 3: Everything is a Weapon

**Improvised Weaponry.** You gain proficiency with improvised weapons.

**Improvised Weapon Die.** You roll a number of d4s equal to your rage damage instead of 1d4 for improvised weapons.

**Another Weapon.** While your Rage is active, you can make a Bonus Action Attack with an improvised weapon.

### Level 6: Each Object is Different

**Improvised Mastery.** While your Rage is active, attacks made with improvised weapons have the *Sap* weapon mastery.

**Impressive Physique.** You also count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity.

**Magic Weapon Break.** When you activate your rage, you may destroy a magic weapon you wield and apply the item's bonus properties to improvised weapons. When your rage ends, you may have the item restored.

### Level 10: Toss Me!

Once per turn while raging, you can replace one attack to toss a creature within 5 ft a distance equal to 5 plus 5 times your Strength modifier (minimum 1). If there is a creature in this path, you can make an improvised weapon attack against it and the tossed creature will land next to it.

**Magic Item Break.** When you activate your rage, you may destroy a magic item you wield. When your rage ends, you may have the item restored.

### Level 14: Force Breaking

Once per turn, you can throw an object with the power to destroy medium or smaller non-magical objects and punch holes into larger objects 5 ft by 5 ft. This can also destroy structures made of Force such as *Wall of Force* and *Cage of Force*.
