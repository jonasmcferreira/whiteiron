# Custom Classes

Here you'll find all our homebrew subclasses â€” tested in the cold, balanced through play, and built with narrative in mind.

Each subclass includes:

- Flavor text and theme
- Mechanical breakdown (features per level)
- Playtest notes and changelogs

## ðŸª¤ Fighter: The Wrangler _(in development)_

A battlefield controller who uses nets, chains, and tethers to dominate the battlefield and protect allies.
