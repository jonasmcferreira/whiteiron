The Lusitanians lived in a variety of settlements, ranging from fortified hilltop towns (*oppida*) to smaller villages and important natural sites. Each location has its own unique characteristics and significance within the Lusitanian culture.

- **Conimbriga:** A large, fortified town that stands as a symbol of Lusitanian strength and unity. Known for its impressive walls and well-planned streets, Conimbriga could serve as the capital of your Lusitanian kingdom. It is a center of governance, trade, and cultural exchange, where leaders gather to make decisions that affect the entire region.

- **Lancia Oppidana:** A smaller town strategically located near a river. Lancia Oppidana is renowned for its skilled artisans and bustling marketplaces. The town thrives on trade, both within Lusitania and with neighboring tribes. It is also a hub for crafting weapons, tools, and intricate jewelry that reflect Lusitanian artistry.

- **Viriathus's Village:** A small, rural settlement nestled in the mountains, known for producing some of the most formidable warriors in Lusitania. The village is isolated, making it a stronghold of traditional Lusitanian culture and values. Its people are hardy and self-sufficient, living off the land and training in the art of guerrilla warfare to defend their home.

- **Balsa:** A vibrant port city located on the southern coast. Balsa is the gateway to the wider Mediterranean world, facilitating trade with other cultures. Its docks are filled with ships from distant lands, bringing exotic goods and ideas that blend with Lusitanian traditions. The city is also known for its skilled navigators and shipbuilders.

- **Oppidum of Turdulum:** A major hillfort that serves as a military and strategic center for the Lusitanians. Turdulum is famed for its impenetrable stone walls and the fierce warriors who defend them. It acts as a central hub for coordinating resistance efforts against Roman encroachment, where warriors gather, plans are forged, and alliances are made.

- **The Sacred Grove of Endovelicus:** A mystical forest revered as a sacred site where the veil between the mortal world and the divine is thin. The grove is a place of pilgrimage for those seeking guidance from the gods, conducting rituals, or communing with the spirits of nature. It is said that powerful relics and ancient secrets lie hidden within its depths.

- **Roman Outposts:** Scattered across the fringes of Lusitania, these fortified encampments symbolize the growing threat of Roman domination. Each outpost serves as a base for Roman soldiers, a staging ground for further incursions, and a point of control over the local population. Lusitanian warriors often target these outposts in daring raids to disrupt Roman plans and free captured kin.

- **The River Tagus:** A mighty river that serves as both a lifeline and a natural boundary. The Tagus is crucial for transportation, agriculture, and trade. Its waters are believed to be imbued with spiritual significance, and many Lusitanian legends speak of spirits that dwell within the river, guarding its secrets and offering protection to those who respect its power.
