# Lusitania

**Era:** Ancient Iberia, during the height of Roman expansion into the western regions.

**Location:** The rugged, mountainous heartland of Lusitania, in what is now central and northern Portugal and western Spain. This land is marked by steep, forested hills, deep river valleys, and ancient stone settlements. The Lusitani people, a proud and fiercely independent Celtic tribe, inhabit these lands.

## The Lusitanian Highlands

The Lusitanian Highlands are a region of natural beauty and mysticism, where the veil between the physical world and the spiritual realm is thin. Dense forests of oak and chestnut trees cover the slopes, while ancient stone circles and dolmens stand as reminders of forgotten rites and ancient powers. The Lusitani people live in fortified hilltop settlements known as *oppida*, where they raise cattle, hunt in the wilds, and forge weapons of bronze and iron.

The Lusitani worship a pantheon of gods tied to nature and war, chief among them being Endovelicus, the god of health and prophecy, and Ataegina, the goddess of rebirth and fertility. Druids and seers hold great influence, guiding their people with wisdom drawn from the land and the stars.

## The Roman Threat

The time is one of great turmoil. The Roman Republic, ever-expanding, has turned its gaze toward the rich lands of the Iberian Peninsula. Roman legions, under the command of ambitious generals, have begun their campaigns to subjugate the native tribes, bringing with them the promise of civilizationâ€”and the threat of annihilation.

The Lusitani, under the leadership of the charismatic and cunning chieftain Viriathus, have resisted the Roman advance with guerrilla warfare, striking from the shadows of their mountain strongholds. But as the war drags on, the Lusitani face internal strife, dwindling resources, and the ever-present danger of betrayal.
