## Divine Influence

## Conclusion

- **Lusitanian Victory:** The Lusitani manage to repel the Romans, securing their independence and preserving their culture, though at a great cost.
- **Roman Conquest:** The Romans succeed in conquering Lusitania, imposing their rule, but perhaps at the cost of their own integrity or due to a significant betrayal.
- **Stalemate:** Both sides agree to a tenuous peace, with Lusitania becoming a Roman client state, allowing some degree of autonomy while still under Roman influence.
- **Divine Catastrophe:** The gods’ intervention leads to a cataclysmic event, forcing both sides to unite against a common threat or resulting in the destruction of one or both civilizations.

This campaign offers rich opportunities for role-playing, strategic planning, and exploration of both personal and cultural conflicts. The clash between the Roman and Lusitanian pantheons adds a layer of mythic grandeur to the historical struggle, making for an epic and memorable adventure.
