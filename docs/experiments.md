# Experimental Rules

Mechanics we're testing, bending, or rewriting — ranging from gritty survival tweaks to crafting systems and hireling rules.

## 🥶 Survival Mechanics

- [Cold Exposure Rules](experiments/cold-exposure.md) – Endure the chill or freeze mid-quest.
- [Fatigue & Shelter](experiments/cold-exposure.md#fatigue) – Optional subsystem for resting and long travel.

## 🛠️ Crafting Systems

- [Crafting in the Wasteland](experiments/crafting.md) – Resource-based gear creation and enchantment.

## 🙋 Hireling Rules

- [Servlings & Companions](experiments/servlings.md) – How to safely run non-combatants and crafters in a deadly world.
