# Experimental Rules

Mechanics we're testing, bending, or rewriting — ranging from gritty survival tweaks to crafting systems and hireling rules.

## Survival Mechanics

- [Cold Exposure Rules]() – Endure the chill or freeze mid-quest.
- [Fatigue & Shelter]() – Optional subsystem for resting and long travel.

## Crafting Systems

- [Crafting in the Wasteland]() – Resource-based gear creation and enchantment.

## Hireling Rules

- [Servlings & Companions]() – How to safely run non-combatants and crafters in a deadly world.

> These rules are always under refinement. We encourage playtesting, tweaking, and feedback.
