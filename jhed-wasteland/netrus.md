# Netrus Village

Breaking the snowdrift is a constant plume of smoke, a village teetering at the cliffs to overlook the J'hed Bay. The left, a lonely stone spire jutting towards the expanse. Then a collection of dark wooden longhouses flickering a dim glow of business and respite. The closest structure, a modest two story watch tower signalling your presence has been noticed.

Often found outside, "Giant Home" the spire in Netrus to overlook the wasteland and village. A scraggly Giant covered in whisping white hairs from all parts of his body, at a glance almost looking like a yeti. Lumbering around, fishing and sharing stories. 

Nick does not interfere until he is asked with village disputes, but his decisions aren't questioned. The first time someone may act against Netrus he will simply warn the offender, next is exile and the hospitality of Netrus is gone. Any other acts against Netrus will make Nick hostile

Nick will not leave the village for more than a few hours, believing Netrus will be attacked if it loses his protection (he is right)

**Special Rewards**: Hill Giant Belt, and the ability to improve it up qualities

### Hidden Arcane Complex

Underneath Netrus is a small arcane chamber with an Ancient Relic. The glyphs and design of the sanctum reverse the magical emminations, specifically designed and attuned to this stone. This stone is the reason everyone in Netrus is charmed as the stones orginal purpose creates a madness of violence. If this chamber is destroyed, all creatures will become hostile to eachother in Netrus
