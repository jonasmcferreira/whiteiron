# Netrus

## Common Features

- All villages have beasts of burden.
- Trade resources among villages and with the greater kingdom.
- Each village has its own focus and unique characteristics.
- Religion plays a significant role in village life.

One way to make NPCs important is to limit overlapping function. If an NPC has a unique ability, is killed or captured, this service is not available in Jhed until the problem is resolved

## Netrus - Village One

Breaking the snowdrift is a constant plume of smoke, a village teetering at the cliffs to overlook the Jhed Wasteland. On the left, a lonely stone spire jutting towards the expanse. The rest, a collection of dark wooden longhouses flickering a dim glow of business and respite. The closest structure, a modest two story watch tower signalling your presence has been noticed. At closer inspection, it almost comes across as an ampitheatre with glyphed stonework bordering this break of wilderness. 


## NPCs - Population 20

### "Nick" Ugris, Head of Netrus 

**Stats**: Hill Giant/Storm Giant, **Language**: Giant **Goal**: Keep Netrus Safe, **Weakness**: Rules only by force

Often found outside, "Giant Home" the spire in Netrus to overlook the wasteland and village. A scraggly Giant covered in whisping white hairs from all parts of his body, at a glance almost looking like a yeti. Lumbering around, fishing and sharing stories. 

Nick does not interfere until he is asked with village disputes, but his decisions aren't questioned. The first time someone may act against Netrus he will simply warn the offender, next is exile and the hospitality of Netrus is gone. Any other acts against Netrus will make Nick hostile

Nick will not leave the village for more than a few hours, believing Netrus will be attacked if it loses his protection (he is right)


**Special Rewards**: Hill Giant Belt, and the ability to improve it up qualities

**Revelation**: Nick Ugris is under a madness making him more socialable and desiring to protect Netrus, while making him act more as a Hill Giant, if his Madness is removed he will return to a home in the clouds above Jhed 

### Founding Reasons

    - Northmost tradepost in the Jhed Continent
    - Thief Twin Kings created underground smuggling route from Thieves Key to Netrus
    - Water around Netrus contain intense arcane traces, perfect potion brewing

### Oddities

    - stone's/glyphs of warding everywhere in Netrus
    - charmed when entering, assumed to be from a glyph, hidden truth: relic village is built over
    - fighting arena for disputes/fun/gambling outside of charmed region

### Beasts of Burden info

    - glacial bears, dire wolves, sabertooths, Vegetarian animal?
    - no flying option, Rocs patrol the sky and make large birds hard to keep
    - Removing Rocs can allow flying travel

### Potions

    - Netrus sells potions to neighboring city
    - 3 female potion crafters, mages (hags)
    - party and entire village gets 1 free healing potion each long rest
    - helping village gets stronger potions they can craft and get for free

## NPCs
    
    
Three Sisters - Potion Maker

### Religion

    - Sammul - Tortle Runepriest is the religious icon of Netrus
    - no religion frowned upon (even evil ones)
    - Sammul only cermons about community, and the benefits of hardship of labor
    - Each day, something is tossed off the cliff into Jhed Wasteland as an offering 

Sammul (Tortle) - religious leader, can cast Remove Curse
 accepts all faiths (good/evil), and focuses on guiding people through their faith and crises

### Law

    - Village Four has a noble seat and only desires taxes, the amount is never set.
    - Most disputes are settled through Sammul, else Nick is the final decision
    - The denizens of Netrus don't care about affairs outside of Netrus that don't directly involve them
    - Outside of outward hostility, and theft Netrus only cares about protection of the village

### Food

    - fish and meat in abundance

### Allies, Enemies and Neutral

    - The villagers ask nothing of the party while offering potions, food, and lodging at no cost
    - If the party helps through tasks, donations and protection; this improves the quality and value of these offers
    - Acting against Netrus will come as three warnings, the first being a loss of free support, then exile, and then open hostility on the Jhed Continent

### Expansion and Loss

    - If the population of Netrus shrinks below 10, the village risks total failure and needs the parties help
    - Securing the trade route to the Keys is the best way to expand the population of Jhed while sending out valuable items to begin a gold rush
    - If the village expands it won't all be under the effects of the charm, and Nick won't have enough power to control through force. This will limit potion supply but increase options
