# Thieves Key

## Thieves Post - Starter town

To be defined

## NPCs

### Don (Donald) Vras

Don Vras appears almost as a cliche. Heavy-patched fur garment; matching colour to his greyed hair and a black eyepatch to finish his wardobe. Crossbow slung across the back, a dull blade loosly tied to his belt; always moving, always busy. Almost old enough to have worked under Twin Kings: Ivis and Iluna

**Revelation**: Did work under Ivis and Iluna, was a personal guard

**Race**: Human, **Trade**: Smuggler(bodies), **Goal**: Retire , **Weakness**: Rumors/Gossip/Drink,

Major Visual Feature: Eyepatch

Provides information about Jhed to players and detailed book keeper

### Brimhest

Short even to describe a dwarf, hairy even to describe a dwarf, grumpy even to describe a dwarf, with the reek of beer... that you expect from a dwarf. Scruffy black eyebrows covering the eyes making the oddest of expression. Brimhest acts without resistance and will take defiance as a joke; implying it better be a joke. The most impressive aspect is how efficiently the docks of Thieves Key run under this dunkard.

**Race**: Dwarf, **Trade**: "Mayor", **Goal**: rebuild thieves guild , **Weakness**: Ambition/Rare Ale,

## Features

Depressing would be the one word to describe the Thieves Key, a town of drunk traders and thieves not worth the hassle of law. There are a few signs of the old success, an extravagant piece of jewelry or tattered embossed formalwear, now just relics. Those running the town; Brimhest and his crew, seem to know everything that is going on. As long as business moves, there is no interference. 

## Travel

The only safe way to Jhed is the smuggling route through ice tunnels. Any overland travel is made hopeless due to Roc territory. It is a 5-8 day travel through the pass, but damage from tremors may have changed this

## Growth Conflict

Brimhest could use any increased trade to create thieves that can operate in Jhed
Outer Regions could attempt to take Thieves Key and make a heavily taxed port with rigid rules

Improving Thieves Key connection to Dhuren Tol will give enough resources to keep Outer Region at bay

## Shrink Conflict

Thieves Key is vulnerable to revolt and total failure, this would increase the time it takes for goods to arrive in and out of Jhed. Also remove valuable leads to the Twin Kings Ivis and Iluna

## The Docks

Contrary to the tone of the town, Thieves Key has talented and elaborate dockworks. Given resources they can craft specialized tools to travel through Jhed. They specialize in quicker and stealthier crafts but are flexible to demand

## Loyalists

There are 5 loyalists of old Thieve Kings, if all five are killed or abandon, the village will die out, or fall under the influence of the outer empires

### Loyalist 1 - Brimhest

### Loyalist 2 - Don Vras

### Loyalist 3 - unnamed coward

If two or loyalists are killed, Loyalist 3 will abandon.

### Loyalist 4 -  Kraeta "pirate" Sweatclaw - Aarakokra

Can warn party of the challenges of flight in Jhed, has pegleg. Only Aarakocra. Trying to build a plan to control Rocs or get by without killing them

### Loyalist 5 - Vez'yen Poison Merchant
