# Thieves Key

## Thieves Post - population 100ish

A collection of buildings built into the mouth of a cove illuminated by wandering lanterns. These illegal docks are for cutthroats, pirates, brigands and any business that does not want to be questioned. Everything that happens in this small port goes through Brimhest, you don't need to explain but Brimhest knows or it doesn't happen

This town is not above slavery, but aware that people paid little sell their secrets cheap

This is a place to buy basic adventuring gear, illegal goods, information, boat repairs and a place to disappear

## Locations

### Dockworks

The vast majority of Thieves Key is the pier, docks and drydocks. Demands shouted, wood sawed, metal hammering, ropes hoisted all over the icy planks. Dock workers are visibly branded on their hand and face, making it difficult for them to share information unnoticed. A few gruesome displays in cages or posts with birds pick at the bodies, "Traitor". 

### Brimhest's Nest

Overlooking the entirety of the docks built into the top of the cove like a crowsnest. A few rope ladders dangle below along a hoisted elevator, as each new face or business passes through Brimhest's Nest and there is always a line waiting for their audience with Brimhest  

### Loose Coin - inn

A terrible inn best described as office cubicles

### Brimhest Deepbrew

Short even to describe a dwarf, hairy even to describe a dwarf, grumpy even to describe a dwarf, with the reek of beer... that you expect from a dwarf. Scruffy black eyebrows covering the eyes making the oddest of expression. Brimhest acts without resistance and will take defiance as a joke; implying it better be a joke. The most impressive aspect is how efficiently the docks of Thieves Key run under this dunkard. She is short with her words to avoid giving away information

**Race**: Female Dwarf, **Trade**: Dockmaster,

**Items:** Brimhest has a Sending Stone (first)

with a hidden second floor built into the stone. above functioning as her home. First she keeps the Thieves Key functioning as it is the last legacy of the Royal Twins, missing presumed dead Monarchs, and she has a great pride in her work on the Thieves Key. Second, anything that could be used to grow her influence and assist her network expansion is of great interest to her.

As all with with faults, Brimhest has a particular weakness for rare, quality or expensive alcohols. If she is going to let something slide, this is why

### Don (Donald) Vras

Don Vras appears almost as a cliche. Heavy-patched fur garment; matching colour to his greyed hair and a black eyepatch to finish his wardobe. Crossbow slung across the back, a dull blade loosly tied to his belt; always moving, always busy. Almost old enough to have worked under Twin Kings: Ivis and Iluna

**Revelation**: Did work under Ivis and Iluna, was a personal guard

**Race**: Human, **Trade**: Smuggler(bodies), **Goal**: Retire , **Weakness**: Rumors/Gossip/Drink,

Major Visual Feature: Eyepatch

Provides information about Jhed to players and detailed book keeper

## Features

Depressing would be the one word to describe the Thieves Key, a town of drunk traders and thieves not worth the hassle of law. There are a few signs of the old success, an extravagant piece of jewelry or tattered embossed formalwear. Those running the town; Brimhest and his crew, seem to know everything that is going on. As long as business moves, there is no interference. 

## Travel

The only safe way to Jhed is the smuggling route through ice tunnels. Any overland travel is made hopeless due to Roc territory. It is a 5-8 day travel through the pass, but recently shipments have failed

### Transport Costs

Any delivery from Thieves Key to Netrus has a cost of transporation, this cost is per person required to haul the items

Friendly - 17.4gp
Neutral - 50gp

## Boons and Banes

You want the players actions to shape the towns they interact with, consider what a town gains and loses as the party helps. Tie these actions directly so players feel the benefits and consequences of those actions

### Boons

Helping Vez'yen - Potential Conflict, Vez'yen could overthrow Brimhest

Interested in Ogres and Half-Ogres - Potential Conflict, No longer quiet and secretive

2000gps - Potential Conflict, intrigue thieves to venture to Netrus

Kobold Allies - Potential Conflict, more disorganized

### Banes

Helping Bounty Hunters - Potential Conflict, won't send courriers (as they can be Wanted)

Helping The Flaming Fools - Potential Conflict, won't sell information

Killing a Loyalist - Potential Conflict, will extort players

## Thieves Key and Bounty Hunters

People will pay a lot of money to become lost in J'hed and The Bounty Hunter's success will tarnish Thieves Key reputation. Aiding the Bountry Hunters will help the Outer Empire while also shrinking The Thieves Key

## Kobold Allies

Kobold's are natural thieves and would be great pirate crews to bolster the ranks of Thieves Key, Kobolds will not do a great job following the strictness of Brimhest and become far more chaotic

## Rival Southpost

Southpost is part of the Outer Region and if Southpost gains enough wealth and power will take over Thieves Key

## Retaking UnderRoc (not Book 1)

Holding the UnderRoc bridge is an expensive process that the Outer Region currently doesn't care about. Letting Thieves Key hold the bridge will be a great boon. This will allow thieves to operate in Netrus
