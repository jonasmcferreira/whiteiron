# Thieves Key

## Thieves Post - Starter town

To be defined

## NPCs

### Don (Donald) Vras

Don Vras appears almost as a cliche. Heavy-patched fur garment; matching colour to his greyed hair and a black eyepatch to finish his wardobe. Crossbow slung across the back, a dull blade loosly tied to his belt; always moving, always busy. Almost old enough to have worked under Twin Kings: Ivis and Iluna

**Revelation**: Did work under Ivis and Iluna, was a personal guard

**Race**: Human, **Trade**: Smuggler(bodies), **Goal**: Retire , **Weakness**: Rumors/Gossip/Drink,

Major Visual Feature: Eyepatch

Provides information about Jhed to players and detailed book keeper

### Brimhest

Short even to describe a dwarf, hairy even to describe a dwarf, grumpy even to describe a dwarf, with the reek of beer... that you expect from a dwarf. Scruffy black eyebrows covering the eyes making the oddest of expression. Brimhest acts without resistance and will take defiance as a joke; implying it better be a joke. The most impressive aspect is how efficiently the docks of Thieves Key run under this dunkard.

**Race**: Dwarf, **Trade**: "Mayor", **Goal**: rebuild thieves guild , **Weakness**: Ambition/Rare Ale,

## Features

Depressing would be the one word to describe the Thieves Key, a town of drunk traders and thieves not worth the hassle of law. There are a few signs of the old success, an extravagant piece of jewelry or tattered embossed formalwear, now just relics. Those running the town; Brimhest and his crew, seem to know everything that is going on. As long as business moves, there is no interference. 

## Travel

The only safe way to Jhed is the smuggling route through ice tunnels. Any overland travel is made hopeless due to Roc territory. It is a 5-8 day travel through the pass, but damage from tremors may have changed this

## The Docks

Contrary to the tone of the town, Thieves Key has talented and elaborate dockworks. Given resources they can craft specialized tools to travel through Jhed. They specialize in quicker and stealthier crafts but are flexible to demand

## Loyalists

There are 5 loyalists of old Thieve Kings, if all five are killed or abandon, the village will die out, or fall under the influence of the outer empires

### Loyalist 1 - Brimhest

### Loyalist 2 - Don Vras

### Loyalist 3 - unnamed coward

If two or loyalists are killed, Loyalist 3 will abandon.

### Loyalist 4 -  Kraeta "pirate" Sweatclaw - Aarakokra

Can warn party of the challenges of flight in Jhed, has pegleg. Only Aarakocra. Trying to build a plan to control Rocs or get by without killing them

### Loyalist 5 - Vez'yen Poison Merchant


## Growth

+1 Clearing the Smugglers Route and paying gold

+1 Finding a route from Dhuren Tol or Oravilla 

+1 Relics of the Twin Kings

-1 removing 2 Loyalists (can happen twice)

Thieves Key can help found a thieving network, fall entirely, become a port of the Outer Empire, or linger

### Growth Conflict

Rival Leaders, not all thieves are Loyalists, as Thieves Key grows, rivals will come to challenge Brimhest and sway the party to their side. This conflict makes Thieves Key more vulnerable to the Outer Empires. The players could choose to be this rival faction

## Thieves Key and Bounty Hunters

People will pay a lot of money to become lost in J'hed and The Bounty Hunter's success will tarnish Thieves Key reputation. Aiding the Bountry Hunters will help the Outer Empire while also shrinking The Thieves Key
