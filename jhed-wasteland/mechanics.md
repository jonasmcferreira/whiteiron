## Madness Effects DMG(2014)

Madness can be short-term, long-term, or indefinite. Most relatively mundane effects impose short-term madness, which lasts for just a few minutes. More horrific effects or cumulative effects can result in long-term or indefinite madness.

A character afflicted with short-term madness is subjected to an effect from the Short-Term Madness table for 1d10 minutes.

A character afflicted with long-term madness is subjected to an effect from the Long-Term Madness table for 1d10 × 10 hours.

A character afflicted with indefinite madness gains a new character flaw from the Indefinite Madness table that lasts until cured.

### Short-Term Madness

|26–30   | “I try to become more like someone else I know—adopting his or her style of dress, mannerisms, and name.”  |
|31–35   | 	“I must bend the truth, exaggerate, or outright lie to be interesting to other people.” |
|36–45   | 	“Achieving my goal is the only thing of interest to me, and I’ll ignore everything else to pursue it.” |

|86–95   | “I can’t take anything seriously. The more serious the situation, the funnier I find it.” |
|96–100   | “I’ve discovered that I really like killing people.” |

### Curing Madness

A calm emotions spell can suppress the effects of madness, while a lesser restoration spell can rid a character of a short-term or long-term madness. Depending on the source of the madness, remove curse or dispel evil might also prove effective. A greater restoration spell or more powerful magic is required to rid a character of indefinite madness.

## Cold Exposure

In the harsh environment of the Arctic Wastelands, managing your exposure to the cold is crucial for survival. This mechanic will help track rations, fuel for camping, and exhaustion levels through difficulty checks.

## Cold Exposure Difficulty Checks

**Exposure Levels**:

- **Comfortable**: No adverse effects.
- **Mild Discomfort**: DC 8 Survival Check, else DC 8 Constitution save against exhaustion.
- **Cold**: DC 12 Survival Check, else DC 12 Constitution save against exhaustion.
- **Severe Cold**: DC 16 Survival Check, else DC 16 Constitution save against exhaustion.
- **Deadly Cold**: DC 20 Survival Check, else DC 20 Constitution save against exhaustion.

**Conditions Affecting Difficulty**:

- **Base Weather**: Use the table above for standard conditions.
- **Severe Weather**: During blizzards or extreme cold conditions, increase the DC by 2.
- **Cold Resistance**: Certain equipment, spells, or abilities can reduce the DC of checks. Each such item or spell reduces the DC by 2.

## Managing Exposure

**Rest and Shelter**:

- **Warm Shelter**: Spending an hour in a warm shelter or using a heat source reduces the current exposure level by one step.
- **Long Rest**: Fully resting (long rest) in a warm environment resets exposure to Comfortable.

**Warm Clothing**:

- **Basic Cold-Weather Gear**: Reduces the DC of checks by 2.
- **Advanced Cold-Weather Gear**: Reduces the DC of checks by 4.

**Magical Warmth**:

- **Spells**: Certain spells (e.g., *Leomund's Tiny Hut*, *Control Temperature*) provide temporary relief, reducing the DC of checks by 2 or even eliminating the need for checks while active.

## Fuel and Camping

- **Fuel for Warmth**: Each hour of maintaining a campfire or similar heat source requires 1 unit of fuel (e.g., wood, oil, etc.). Successfully setting up a campfire reduces the current exposure level by one step.
- **Rations**: Each day, adventurers must consume 1 unit of rations to maintain energy. Missing a day's rations results in 1 level of exhaustion.
- **Shelters**: Tents and magical shelters (like *Leomund's Tiny Hut*) provide warmth, reducing the need for higher difficulty checks and fuel consumption.

## Scavenging

- **Foraging**: Players can forage for food and fuel, requiring successful Survival checks. Failure may result in no gain and potential exposure increase due to extended time in the elements.
- **Beasts:** all creatures in Jhed can defend themselves, should always be an encounter
- **Plants:** these also defend themselves

## Exhaustion Levels

Exhaustion caused by cold exposure follows standard D&D rules:

1. **Level 1**: Disadvantage on Ability Checks.
2. **Level 2**: Speed halved.
3. **Level 3**: Disadvantage on Attack Rolls and Saving Throws.
4. **Level 4**: Hit Point Maximum halved.
5. **Level 5**: Speed reduced to 0.
6. **Level 6**: Death.

**Recovery from Exhaustion**:
- Each level of exhaustion requires one full day of rest in a warm environment with adequate food and water.
- Magical means (such as the *Greater Restoration* spell) can reduce exhaustion levels.

## Example Scenario

**Hour 1**: The party sets out into the wasteland. The base weather is Mild Discomfort, so they must make a DC 8 Survival check or a DC 8 Constitution save. Success means no adverse effects; failure results in mild discomfort and potential exhaustion.

**Hour 2**: A blizzard hits, increasing the condition to Cold (DC 14 checks). Each party member makes a DC 14 Survival check or a DC 14 Constitution save.

**Hour 3**: They find a cave to shelter in, setting up a campfire (using 1 unit of fuel per hour). Successfully setting up the campfire reduces their condition by one level, making it Mild Discomfort (DC 8 checks).

**Resting**: They take a long rest in the cave, resetting their exposure to Comfortable.
