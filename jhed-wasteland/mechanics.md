## The Wild Food of Jhed

Eating fresh raw meat or fruits of Jhed wilderness have mostly positive effects. 

| roll | beast/monstrosity        | plant | humanoid |
|------|--------------------------|-------|----------|
| 1-4  | poisoned                 | ----- | curse    |
| 5-19 | cold resistance 24 hours | ----- | curse    |
| 20   | specific to mob          | ----- | curse    |

Kobolds, Lizardfolk and Yuan-ti ignore the curse of eating humanoids

### Scavenging for food/water

There is no easy meal or prey in J'hed, scavenging takes the 8 hour day

Survival Check DC 16, on a success roll on wilderness table (to be built)

Investigation Check DC 16, on a sucess roll on scavanged supplies table (to be built)

## Replacing Key NPCs

Choices and consequences could lead to key NPC functions becoming unavailable, like the ability to remove curse depending on the party compositions. To replace an NPC the party has to convince an outsider of the Outer Regions to endure and live in Jhed, the easiest way to do this is gold, and it would be difficult for this cost to be less than 5,000gps

## Macguffin

### Scaleplum 

a deep blue fruit that grows on J'hed fungi in the shape of a bumpy plum/acorn
 - consuming one grants cold resist for 8 hours
 - can be used to create combination healing/cold resist potion

### Steel Quartz

indestructable material found in J'hed, it can't be reshaped by any means
   - immunity to all damage

### Ooze Ichor

   - causes hallucinations when touched
   

## Cold Exposure (simplified)

No source of heat? level of exhaustion gained
Burning supplies is acceptable form of heat
Ignore if you have cold resistance

## Exhaustion Levels (old), we could use this...

Exhaustion caused by cold exposure follows standard D&D rules:

1. **Level 1**: Disadvantage on Ability Checks.
2. **Level 2**: Speed halved.
3. **Level 3**: Disadvantage on Attack Rolls and Saving Throws.
4. **Level 4**: Hit Point Maximum halved.
5. **Level 5**: Speed reduced to 0.
6. **Level 6**: Death.

**Recovery from Exhaustion**:
- Each level of exhaustion requires one full day of rest in a warm environment with adequate food and water.
- Magical means (such as the *Greater Restoration* spell) can reduce exhaustion levels.

## Official Mechanics

### Madness Effects DMG(2014)

Madness can be short-term, long-term, or indefinite. Most relatively mundane effects impose short-term madness, which lasts for just a few minutes. More horrific effects or cumulative effects can result in long-term or indefinite madness.

A character afflicted with short-term madness is subjected to an effect from the Short-Term Madness table for 1d10 minutes.

A character afflicted with long-term madness is subjected to an effect from the Long-Term Madness table for 1d10 × 10 hours.

A character afflicted with indefinite madness gains a new character flaw from the Indefinite Madness table that lasts until cured.

#### Short-Term Madness

|d100 | Effect (lasts 1d10 minutes)     |
|---- | ------------ |
|01–20   | The character retreats into his or her mind and becomes paralyzed. The effect ends if the character takes any damage.     |
|21–30   | The character becomes incapacitated and spends the duration screaming, laughing, or weeping.  |
|31–40   | The character becomes frightened and must use his or her action and movement each round to flee from the source of the fear      |
|41–50   | The character begins babbling and is incapable of normal speech or spellcasting. |
|51–60   | The character must use his or her action each round to attack the nearest creature. |
|61–70   | The character experiences vivid hallucinations and has disadvantage on ability checks. |
|71–75   | The character does whatever anyone tells him or her to do that isn’t obviously self-­destructive. |
|76–80   | The character experiences an overpowering urge to eat something strange such as dirt, slime, or offal. |
|81–90   | The character is stunned. |
|91–100   | The character falls unconscious. |

#### Long-Term Madness

|d100 | Effect (lasts 1d10 hours)     |
|---- | ------------ |
|01–10   | The character feels compelled to repeat a specific activity over and over, such as washing hands, touching things, praying, or counting coins.    |
|11–20   | The character experiences vivid hallucinations and has disadvantage on ability checks.    |
|21–30   | The character suffers extreme paranoia. The character has disadvantage on Wisdom and Charisma checks.  |
|31–40   | The character regards something (usually the source of madness) with intense revulsion, as if affected by the antipathy effect of the Antipathy/Sympathy spell.   |
|41–45   | The character experiences a powerful delusion. Choose a potion. The character imagines that he or she is under its effects. |
|46–55   | The character becomes attached to a “lucky charm,” such as a person or an object, and has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws while more than 30 feet from it. |
|56–65   | The character is blinded (25%) or deafened (75%). |
|66–75   | The character experiences uncontrollable tremors or tics, which impose disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws that involve Strength or Dexterity. |
|76–80   | The character suffers from partial amnesia. The character knows who he or she is and retains racial traits and class features, but doesn’t recognize other people or remember anything that happened before the madness took effect. |
|81–85   | The character experiences an overpowering urge to eat something strange such as dirt, slime, or offal. |
|86–90   | Whenever the character takes damage, he or she must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throws or be affected as though he or she failed a saving throw against the confusion spell. The confusion effect lasts for 1 minute. |
|91–95   | The character loses the ability to speak. |
|96–100   | The character falls unconscious. No amount of jostling or damage can wake the character. |

#### Indefinite Madness

|---- | ------------ |
|01–15   | “Being drunk keeps me sane.”   |
|16–25   | "I keep whatever I find."    |
|26–30   | “I try to become more like someone else I know—adopting his or her style of dress, mannerisms, and name.”  |
|31–35   | 	“I must bend the truth, exaggerate, or outright lie to be interesting to other people.” |
|36–45   | 	“Achieving my goal is the only thing of interest to me, and I’ll ignore everything else to pursue it.” |
|46–50   | “I find it hard to care about anything that goes on around me.” |
|51–55   | 	“I don’t like the way people judge me all the time.” |
|56–70   | 	“I am the smartest, wisest, strongest, fastest, and most beautiful person I know.”|
|71–80   |“I am convinced that powerful enemies are hunting me, and their agents are everywhere I go. I am sure they’re watching me all the time.” |
|81–85   | “There’s only one person I can trust. And only I can see this special friend.” |
|86–95   | “I can’t take anything seriously. The more serious the situation, the funnier I find it.” |
|96–100   | “I’ve discovered that I really like killing people.” |

#### Curing Madness

A calm emotions spell can suppress the effects of madness, while a lesser restoration spell can rid a character of a short-term or long-term madness. Depending on the source of the madness, remove curse or dispel evil might also prove effective. A greater restoration spell or more powerful magic is required to rid a character of indefinite madness.

### Exhaustion Levels

Exhaustion caused by cold exposure follows standard D&D rules:

1. **Level 1**: Disadvantage on Ability Checks.
2. **Level 2**: Speed halved.
3. **Level 3**: Disadvantage on Attack Rolls and Saving Throws.
4. **Level 4**: Hit Point Maximum halved.
5. **Level 5**: Speed reduced to 0.
6. **Level 6**: Death.

#### Extreme Cold

Whenever the temperature is at or below **0 degrees Fahrenheit**, a creature exposed to the cold must succeed on a **DC 10 Constitution saving throw** at the end of **each hour or gain one level of exhaustion**. Creatures with **resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeed** on the saving throw, as do creatures wearing cold weather gear (thick coats, gloves, and the like) and creatures naturally adapted to cold climates.


### Frigid Water (page 110)

A creature can be immersed in frigid water for a number of minutes equal to its Constitution score before suffering any ill effects. Each additional minute spent in frigid water requires the creature to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion
