<h1 id="adventures">Adventures</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This book contains a complete Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventure, set in the frozen wilderness of Jhed. This adventure is designed for characters of levels 1 to 4, with a focus on exploration, survival, and uncovering ancient secrets.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>For centuries, the icy continent of Jhed has been a place of mystery and peril. Explorers, smugglers, and outcasts brave its frozen expanse, lured by tales of arcane power and ancient civilizations buried beneath the ice. The town of Netrus serves as the last beacon of civilization, its survival dependent on a fragile trade route with Thieves Key.</p>
<p>Your journey begins at <strong>Thieves Key</strong>, a notorious halfway point between the civilized world and the icy wilderness of Jhed. Perched in a cove with creaking piers and flickering lanterns, this is a place where <strong>secrets are traded as often as goods</strong>. Thieves, cutthroats, pirates, and outcasts gather here under the watchful eyes of <strong>Brimhest Deepbrew</strong>, the gruff, beer-stained dwarf who runs this lawless haven. Nothing happens here without Brimhest knowing, or at least approving.</p>
<p>Overlooking it all is <strong>Brimhest's Nest</strong>, a lofty perch built into the cliffs, from where Brimhest watches the comings and goings of everyone in Thieves Key. To meet with Brimhest, you'll need to wait your turn in line, or if you're smart, grease the right palms to skip it. Below, in the <strong>Loose Coin</strong>, adventurers and thieves alike seek shelter, though the inn is little more than a series of shanty cubicles where <strong>privacy is a luxury no one can afford</strong>.</p>
<p>This is where your journey begins—a <strong>final taste of warmth and drink</strong> before stepping into the cold jaws of the Jhed Continent.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Journey to Netrus is divided into several parts:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Thieves Key</strong>: Players gather supplies, meet key NPCs, and prepare for their journey.</li>
<li><strong>The Smuggler’s Tunnel</strong>: A perilous underground passage filled with challenges, from environmental hazards to hostile creatures.</li>
<li><strong>Arrival in Netrus</strong>: The adventurers defend the town against a looming threat, with opportunities for alliances or betrayal.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="level-one-adventure-journey-to-netrus">Level One Adventure: Journey To Netrus</h2>
<p>For weeks, the smuggler's route between <strong>Netrus</strong>—a small but vital frontier town in Jhed—and Thieves Key has gone cold. The last crew sent with essential supplies and trade goods never returned. Netrus relies heavily on these deliveries to survive the harsh winters and to offload the discoveries from the frozen wastes. If the route is not re-established, the town will collapse, and the situation is dire enough that Brimhest has approved your expedition to deliver a <strong>50 lbs package</strong> critical to their survival.</p>
<p>You have been promised <strong>600 gp</strong> to deliver this package, with an additional <strong>100 gp per extra crate</strong> you can carry, but be warned: any lost cargo will cost you <strong>150 gp in penalties</strong>, and if the main package isn't delivered, the entire deal is void.</p>
<h3 id="the-smugglers-tunnel-your-first-steps-into-jhed">The Smuggler's Tunnel: Your First Steps Into Jhed</h3>
<p>Your immediate goal is to reach <strong>Netrus</strong> by navigating the <strong>Smuggler's Tunnel</strong>, which starts at <strong>The Witch’s Nip</strong>, a foreboding entrance to an underground path leading into Jhed. It's a <strong>two-day journey by boat</strong> from Thieves Key, through treacherous waters and into the heart of <strong>Roc territory</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Roc</strong>, a massive bird that patrols the skies over Jhed, is a constant threat, forcing smugglers to use these dangerous underground routes. Any attempt to travel overland would end in certain death beneath its talons.</p>
<p>Don Vras, a seasoned smuggler with a <strong>dark past</strong>, will be your ferry captain. As you set sail, he fills the air with tales of the dangers ahead—how the Roc claims vast stretches of territory and how the last crew that attempted this route vanished without a trace. He describes how the Roc’s shadow darkens the waters, a grim omen for anyone daring enough to cross its domain. He has sailed to the <strong>Witch's Nip</strong> many times before.</p>
<h3 id="the-journey-begins">The Journey Begins</h3>
<p>With your supplies packed and your nerves steeled, you prepare to leave Thieves Key. The smuggler’s boat awaits, its dark wood creaking as it sways on the icy water. Your last taste of warmth fades as the cold air of Jhed creeps closer. From here, you’ll travel through the <strong>Smuggler’s Tunnel</strong>, past the <strong>UnderRoc Bridge</strong>, and into the heart of <strong>Netrus</strong>.</p>
<p>Your quest is simple: <strong>deliver the package</strong>, survive the journey, and perhaps uncover the untold riches of the <strong>frozen wilderness</strong> beyond.</p>
<p>But beware—the last courier crew never made it back.</p>
<h3 id="sail-and-arrival-at-the-witchs-nip">Sail and Arrival at The Witch's Nip</h3>
<p>Don Vras is a gruff individual, but he is talkative as he's ferried his share of adventurers to the <strong>Witch's Nip</strong></p>
<p>After days at sea, navigating treacherous icy waters and avoiding the sharp gaze of the Roc, the sloop finally sails into a narrow inlet known as <strong>The Witch’s Nip</strong>. The biting cold seems to intensify as the boat glides between the towering, jagged cliffs that guard the cove like the fangs of a giant beast. As the crew secures the sloop to the frost-covered dock, a strange, echoing silence replaces the rhythmic lapping of the waves, broken only by the faint, distant howl of the wind.</p>
<h3 id="the-smugglers-tunnel">The Smuggler's Tunnel</h3>
<p>The <strong>Smuggler’s Tunnel</strong> is a lifeline between <strong>Thieves Key</strong> and <strong>Netrus</strong>, cutting through miles of treacherous terrain that would otherwise take weeks to navigate overland. While at first glance the tunnel may seem like a marvel of ancient craftsmanship, closer inspection reveals its more improvised nature. The stonework is uneven, as if hastily carved by many hands over time, with sections reinforced with mismatched materials. Cracks riddle the walls, and patches of ice creep in through the roof.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/ice-cave.jpg" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="Ice Cave" src="../images/ice-cave.jpg" /></a></p>
<p><strong>The Tunnel’s Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Much of the tunnel has an upward incline, making it more of a trek than a leisurely walk. The party will need to watch their footing, as patches of ice make travel treacherous.</li>
<li>Crude, ice-coated railings line parts of the passage, hinting at past traffic, though they are worn and unreliable in many places.</li>
<li>The residual water flows slowly but steadily, forming shallow pools and slick surfaces. Sharp rocks and ice floes occasionally jut out, making movement tricky.</li>
<li>As the party ventures deeper, they discover that the tunnel isn’t as simple as a straight path. While the main passage stretches onward, there are occasional forks, offshoots, and side passages. These side tunnels lead into smaller alcoves or dead ends—remnants of old excavation attempts, collapsed tunnels, or secret storage areas from smuggling days gone by. Some forks are clearly marked with old <strong>Thieves' Cant symbols</strong> for those trained in its use.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>DM Note:
The journey through the Smuggler's Tunnel doesn’t need to follow a linear path. Tailor the experience based on the party’s composition and decisions. They may navigate primarily through the Boarded Walls or face the Ice Wall.</p>
<p>If the party gets stuck, introduce Kresh and Krew to assist them. The goal is to keep the adventure dynamic and engaging, ensuring that each encounter feels fresh and responsive to their actions.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="encounter-boarded-wall">Encounter: Boarded Wall</h3>
<p>As the tunnel twists and narrows, the party will come across several makeshift wooden barriers erected by past smugglers and thieves. Each is marked with <strong>Thieves’ Cant</strong>, warning of the dangers ahead. A <strong>Rogue</strong> or anyone who can read the code will recognize the symbols, which indicate traps, potential ambushes, or secret passages hidden behind the walls.</p>
<p>Scattered along the path, <strong>boarded walls</strong> present a challenge: <strong>destroy them and risk traps</strong> or <strong>find another way around</strong>. Some paths behind the walls could be shortcuts, while others may hide deadly hazards. The decision is up to the players.</p>
<p>A rogue investigating can be told the result of their roll before destroying the blockade. Each path must be traveled for about 30 minutes before the result happens.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Too Cold</strong> The path is long and cold. The party takes 1 Cold Damage.</li>

<h3 id="encounter-ghost-of-the-past-i">Encounter: Ghost of the Past I</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>DM Note:  After the party wakes from their first short rest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the party rests for the first time inside the tunnel, something unsettling happens. In the stillness of the frozen caverns, as the campfire flickers and begins to die down, an ethereal form materializes. Barely visible, refracted through the ice walls, it speaks in a voice that is both chilling and mournful:</p>
<p><strong>"Will you be any different?"</strong> it asks in <strong>Old Common</strong>, the words echoing in the icy wind. The figure lingers for only a moment before fading into the frozen darkness.</p>
<p>This ghostly figure does not engage the players directly but serves as a haunting reminder that many have come before them—and not all made it out.</p>
<h3 id="encounter-kresh-and-krew">Encounter: Kresh and Krew</h3>
<p>The faint sound of iron against ice echoes before stalagtites above you buckles and breaks. Three hulking Lizardfolk fall from above.  </p>
<p>They only speak Draconic, but clearly have climbing gear, tools and will help the party for trade through gestures if no party member speaks draconic  </p>
<p>Kresh and Krew won't stick around to help the party further and dig down to the waters</p>
<p>Lizardfolk names should all start with "Kr"</p>
<h3 id="encounter-a-wall-of-ice">Encounter: A Wall of Ice</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>DM note: quick simple obstacle</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the party ventures deeper into the Smuggler’s Tunnel, the cavern opens wide, revealing a formidable wall of ice that blocks the way forward. Chunks of debris are haphazardly stacked, remnants of a violent tremor that once split the passage. The jagged ice wall looms 25 feet above the highest pile of debris, and a shadowy figure—a Kobold—can be glimpsed at the top, briefly taking interest before darting away, leaving a sense of foreboding in its wake.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/map-1-ice-wall.jpeg" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="ice wall" src="../images/map-1-ice-wall.jpeg" /></a></p>
<p>Characters attempting to climb the wall will suffer 1 piercing damage from the sharp terrain if they use their climb speed. Those without a climb speed will require assistance (e.g., climbing gear, rope, or pitons).</p>
<p>You may increase the challenge by having the Kobolds use the opportunity to ambush the party, hiding in the shadows and potentially shoving characters or cutting ropes when they reach the top.</p>

<h3 id="encounter-remnants-of-the-trade-party">Encounter : Remnants of the Trade Party</h3>
<p>As the main tunnel forks, a <strong>Boarded Wall</strong> to the left has been smashed open, and trails of blood lead in both directions, hinting at recent violence. </p>
<p>Just past the boarded wall, tucked in an alcove, lies a makeshift wooden barrier behind which a few corpses (six in total) are scattered about. They wear the tattered clothing of the <strong>Outer Empire</strong>, but they are devoid of weapons, armor, or gold, as if they were picked clean. Something large has taken bites from the bodies, with evidence of both giant-sized and smaller bites.</p>
<p><strong>Surprise Encounter</strong>:  If the party moves closer or investigates around the bodies, <strong>2-4</strong> of the corpses will suddenly rise as <strong>Zombies</strong>, surprising the party and adding a sense of urgency to the encounter.</p>
<p><strong>Oniteth the Scouter</strong>: Female Goliath (frost) Survivor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DM note: avoid giving another NPC a glaive</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Among the chaos, hiding behind the makeshift wooden barrier and through a crawlspace, <strong>Oniteth</strong>, a female Goliath survivor, is trembling with fear. She looks gaunt and close to death, shaking while gripping her glaive tightly (she will not give it up). Oniteth wears the garments of the <strong>Outer Empire</strong> and appears visibly shaken.</p>
<p><strong>Dialogue:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Apologies, and thank you! I hate it, but I can't handle the frontline now. I have an important letter for Nick Elder of Netrus; it's the only thing I could safeguard."</p>
<p>"I was stationed at UnderRoc searching for this group when something giant started thrashing about, and I just hid."</p>

<p>The tunnel opens up to a cliffside where a bridge connects two towering cliffs. At either end of the bridge stands a stone tower, each two floors high with arrow slits and vantage points, domed and covered at the top. The bridge stretches a daunting <strong>600 feet</strong> long, shrouded in fog.</p>
<h4 id="bridge-entrance">Bridge Entrance</h4>
<p>The Kobolds would rather complete a trade and run away. They search for food, treasures, and dragons.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DM Note: If the characters prefer to avoid combat, there is a cost involved; they must trade at a loss.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Trade</strong>: The Kobolds are very demanding. When they see the party carrying the crates, they become very interested. If you wish to trade for passage, they will ask for <strong>1 Quest Crate</strong> and one of the following: all your rations, all your coins, or all your weapons. The Kobolds don't have the patience to do numbers, so they only like to trade in all-or-nothing values.</p>
<p><strong>Combat</strong>: The first player to move triggers a Hunter's Trap. If Kobolds are killed before they act, do group Stealth DC 13 to not alert the other Kobolds. (Refer to group checks in the PHB 2014). If the Kobolds are alerted, 18 seconds after combat (3 rounds), D4 Javelins will be thrown from the top of the tower by 3 Kobolds.</p>

<p><strong>Alchemist's Fire</strong> drops on the first person to walk through the door, which can cause panic during combat.</p>
<p><strong>Combat Mechanics</strong>: If alerted, 3 Kobolds plus the ones that fled from outside hide in crates. They surprise attack once, then run to the top floor. The Alchemist's Fire will drop on the first person to walk through the door.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Combat Option</strong>: The party can be permitted to lower the tower floor and stairs, but opening the top floor leads to combat. A crawl space behind a looted shelf can also be discovered.</p>

<h4 id="crawl-space">Crawl Space</h4>
<p>Inside the crawl space, the party finds a <strong>dead guard</strong> in Outer Empire clothing (wearing a chain shirt), along with two notes, <strong>7gp, 14sp, and 98cp</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Note One</strong>: "Yalna, I told you I was coming home soon. I know I could have done better. I wish I wasn't such a coward in these moments, but I am trying."</li>
<li><strong>Note Two</strong>: "Captain Faotil has been locked in his chamber for weeks. A delivery came for him, and he hasn't left. Scouts report sightings of lurking creatures encroaching the pass—no confirmations. The undead have increased in numbers, and we have requested aid. Everyone is on edge."</li>

<p><strong>Puzzle Mechanics</strong>: Halfway up the steps to the top floor An intricate inverted triangular stone door, about 9ft tall, stands before the adventurers. There is no consistent pattern upon the frame or door, but a stone brazier is carved into it.</p>
<p>Casting a cantrip within 30ft of the door fails, but the door glows as the caster feels the energy of the spell drawn to it. Brandishing a magic item will have a similar effect, but will not remove the magical properties of the item.</p>

<p><strong>Setting Off the Ward</strong>: All creatures within 30ft of the door must make an Intelligence Save DC 13, taking 1d6 psychic damage on a failed save. With a plume of red smoke, the arcane lock opens, and the door will remain open for 1 hour (even if forced open).</p>
<p><strong>Behind the Door</strong>: A foul stench of decay and rot fills the room. The walls are covered in script—some in ink, most scratched with bloody fingernails. At a desk, slumped in a chair, lies a human, Captain Faotil, dressed in tattered Old Empire chainmail. His breathing is weak and raspy. Captain Faotil is barely alive and insane. Healing stabilizes him but leaves him catatonic. He can be carried, but he offers no useful actions or information. If attacked, he collapses without resistance.</p>
<p><strong>Script on the Walls</strong>: The writing covering the walls appears to be a mix of mundane military orders, strange symbols, and incomprehensible ramblings. Any adventurer who attempts to read the script must make a Wisdom Save (DC 13) as the madness within the writing begins to seep into their mind. On a failed save, the character screams as the incomprehensible knowledge floods their consciousness, dealing 1d6 psychic damage. On a failure the character is also able to read and understand that the writings reference The Great Works. On a success, the character feels uneasy, no damage is taken, and the writing remains non-sensical.</p>
<h4 id="tower-top">Tower Top</h4>
<p>At the top of the tower, the party will encounter 6 Kobolds and 1 Kobold Aspirant, plus any Kobolds that fled earlier.</p>
<p><strong>Stealth Check (High):</strong> Automatic failure if alerted; the party will notice 6 or more Kobolds preparing to flee.</p>
<p><strong>Combat</strong>: The Kobolds will all throw javelins at the players before swinging down to escape. They will cut any extra lines and can keep a few Kobolds behind for a fight.</p>
<p><strong>Another Route :</strong>
An Investigation Check (High, automatic pass if using Thieves' Cant) reveals a tunnel big enough to crawl through and move crates. It seems to snake its way near the bridge but is not large enough for a wagon. The party can then proceed to the Underpass.</p>
<h4 id="encounter-underpass">Encounter: Underpass</h4>
<p>Squeezing through a tight corridor leads underneath the UnderRoc bridge revealing a hidden yet very intentional passage through the middle that can be crawled through. The stonework can be almost too clean.</p>
<p>Investigation Check DC13: The stonework seems to be washed by acid</p>
<p>Grey Ooze: moving along the corridor is a grey ooze, a still oil slick patch of wet stone and will attack when the party crosses. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>DM Note: Attack the highest hitpoint target as the ooze does 3d6+1 damage and can crit. If the party wants the campaign to be difficult simply attack who is leading the party</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the characters make it to the end of the tunnel, they have successfully passed under the UnderRoc bridge and will emerge at the base of the tower on the opposite side 600ft away.</p>
<h4 id="encounter-the-pass">Encounter: The Pass</h4>
<p>The bridge stretches out before the party, a massive 60ft wide and 600ft long expanse cloaked in a thick, swirling fog. Visibility is limited to 60ft ahead. The air is heavy with the pungent stench of decay, and with every breath, the adventurers feel the poison-laden mist clinging to their throats.</p>
<p>As the party ventures further, they come upon the remains of a shattered caravan. Four bodies lie sprawled around the wreckage. As soon as the party approaches, the corpses jerk to life—<strong>2 zombies</strong> and <strong>2 skeletons</strong>, rising from the carnage to defend this forsaken bridge.</p>
<p><strong>Haunting Charge</strong>: After 3 rounds of combat, on the 4th round, out of the thick fog, the echo of hooves pounding against the stone grows louder. Without warning, a skeletal warhorse emerges, its hollow eyes glowing with a ghastly light as it charges through the fog, attacking the party and vanishing once more. Each round, one of the <strong>3 warhorse skeletons</strong> charges from the fog, attacking before disappearing back into the obscuring mist, only to charge again.</p>
<p><strong>The Battlefield</strong>: Scattered across the bridge are the broken, lifeless bodies of kobolds, who clearly fought fiercely against the undead forces before succumbing. Their traps lie unused, their weapons clutched in rigid hands. The battle was brutal, but the kobolds were no match for the poison and relentless undead.</p>

<p><strong>Loot</strong>: within the remnants of the caravan, the party can find 2 sets of tools (roll randomly) and raw supplies (nails, planks, linens, etc) worth 1d100 copper, silver and gold, and one scale mail with the <em>Outer Empire</em> symbol.</p>
<h3 id="encounter-roc">Encounter: Roc</h3>
<p>Peering through the mist, the adventurers glimpse the cracked beak of a <strong>Gargantuan bird</strong>, its feathers a deep black with purple-tipped edges. Its beady eyes lock onto the trespassers as it lets out a rapid, unnerving clicking noise. With a powerful beat of its wings, the Roc takes to the sky, causing a violent gust of wind to blast toward the party.</p>
<p><strong>Strength Save (DC 19)</strong>: Each player must make a Strength saving throw or be knocked <strong>prone</strong> on a failed save, as the force of the Roc's wings sends them crashing to the ground.</p>
<p>Though the Roc soars off into the distance, the adventurers can sense that they’ve intruded upon its territory. It watches from afar, waiting to defend its domain. However, the party will have the opportunity to <strong>return to face the Roc</strong> later with a <strong>Thieves Sigil</strong>. When properly presented, the Roc will grant them <strong>passage to Smuggler’s Peak</strong>, a hidden location few have the privilege to reach.</p>

<h3 id="encounter-tower-ii">Encounter: Tower II</h3>
<p>The fog clings to the edges of the glacier, framing the massive stone bridge that leads to a tower carved into the icy cliffside, rising 50 feet high. The natural ice walls stretch far beyond the party’s vision, cloaked in mist. As the adventurers approach, they see broad, scaled humanoid figures—<strong>Lizardfolk</strong>-frantically tossing objects off the stone bridge, seemingly clearing the area.</p>
<p>A horn blows, and a deep, rumbling voice speaks in a draconic greeting:<br />
<strong>"You may pass, but no more. Kreeg has claimed this tower for now."</strong></p>
<p>The lizardfolk, uninterested in conflict, make it clear that <strong>entry into the tower is forbidden</strong>. If the party inquires about the tower's occupants, the lizardfolk mention that they only found corpses and kobolds within. They make no move to stop the adventurers from crossing the bridge but block any attempts to enter the tower.</p>
<p>Recently, the <strong>lizardfolk</strong> drove out the kobolds and claimed the tower for themselves. Their numbers are strong—around <strong>20 lizardfolk warriors</strong>—making it clear that any fight would be unwinnable for the party. The lizardfolk acknowledge the party’s strength and suggest they seek them out for a future alliance, but for now, they are too busy securing their hold.</p>
<p>If the party has previously met <strong>Kresh</strong>, they may be <strong>escorted past the tower</strong> peacefully.</p>
<p>The lizardfolk are busy <strong>digging</strong> around the base of the tower, searching for <strong>specimens</strong> of some kind, their intent unclear. However, if tensions rise and the party engages, the lizardfolk will quickly overpower them, intending to <strong>knock the adventurers unconscious</strong> and drag them to the <strong>fighting pit</strong>—a brutal arena described in <strong>Trial One: Combat</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="encounter-obstacle-submerged-passage">Encounter: Obstacle - Submerged Passage</h3>
<p>Ahead, a crack in the ceiling lets water cascade down, forming a waterfall that completely blocks the passage. The adventurers must push through the torrent, forcing them to swim against the current as they continue forward.Crossing the river will take one minute, as there are rocks and a strong current to deal with.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DM Note: A creature can be immersed in frigid water for a number of minutes equal to its Constitution score before suffering any ill effects. Each additional minute spent in frigid water requires the creature to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion. Creatures with resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeed on the saving throw, as do creatures that are naturally adapted to living in ice-cold water. DMG 2014 pg.118</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further down the makeshift river, a faint glow illuminates the water. The source is a cluster of <strong>Scale Plums</strong>—luminescent plants with a soft, eerie light. Observant adventurers may notice, with a successful Perception or Investigation check, a body near the Scale Plums. It appears as though this individual had been trying to reach the plants but slipped and fell, meeting their end in the icy water.</p>
<p><strong>Scale Plums</strong>: This unique plant only grows from the heart of a body that succumbed to the elements in Jhed. With a Nature check, adventurers can identify Scale Plums as having similar properties to <strong>Goodberries</strong>. They offer nourishment and a temporary <strong>resistance to cold</strong> when consumed.</p>

<h3 id="adventure-outline-the-lost-volunteer">Adventure Outline: "The Lost Volunteer"</h3>
<p><strong>Hook</strong> While the party is in Netrus, a wandering undead laborer, known as a "volunteer," stumbles into the village, lost and in disrepair. The appearance of this undead worker, typically found only in Dhuren Tol, raises concern among the villagers and curiosity in the party.</p>
<h3 id="act-1-the-lost-volunteer">Act 1: The Lost Volunteer</h3>
<h4 id="the-volunteers-arrival">The Volunteer’s Arrival</h4>
<p>As the party goes about their business in the bustling village of Netrus, a sudden commotion draws their attention. Villagers gather, whispering and pointing, as a disoriented figure shuffles into view from the edge of the settlement. It’s an undead laborer, known locally as a "volunteer," but this one seems far from the efficient worker it should be.</p>
<p>The volunteer's movements are erratic, its skeletal frame visibly damaged, with bones jutting out at odd angles and a missing arm. Its eyes, dull and lifeless, seem to flicker with a faint, unnatural light. A tattered cloak hangs loosely from its shoulders, fluttering in the cold wind as it stumbles towards the party.</p>
<p>In its remaining hand, the volunteer clutches a crumpled piece of parchment and a peculiar, broken piece of equipment. The parchment, stained and torn, bears cryptic writing and symbols. The equipment, though damaged, still emits a faint aura of magic, hinting at its once important function.</p>
<p>Nick Ugris, the towering Hill Giant leader of Netrus, approaches with a frown etched deeply into his weathered face. "This is not good," he mutters, more to himself than anyone else. Beside him, Sammul, the wise Tortle Runepriest, studies the volunteer with a mix of curiosity and concern.</p>
<p>As the volunteer collapses to the ground, its head jerking spasmodically, Sammul carefully retrieves the note and the broken equipment. He looks up at the party, his eyes serious. "This volunteer is from Dhuren Tol. Something must be terribly wrong for it to end up here in such a state. We need to decipher these clues and find out what’s happening."</p>
<p>Nick nods, his massive hand gently patting the volunteer’s bony shoulder. "You lot," he says, addressing the party, "seems like you’re just the right folks to get to the bottom of this. Let’s see what we can make of these clues and get you ready for the journey ahead."</p>
<h4 id="deciphering-the-clues">Deciphering the Clues</h4>
<p>The note clutched in the skeleton's hand is dirty with mud and coal dust, but no blood. On reading it, a common person will understand the urgent title and the rune, but everything else will look like arcane script, a little fuzzy and symbolic, rather than writing. The note reads:</p>
<ul>
<li>Text:
     <div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Volunteers are going bonkers. Need the Frostfinder to fix The Frostrunner. 
Key: [symbol of a snowflake with a rune in the center]
P.S. Watch out for the trolls. They don’t like visitors.
</code></pre></div>
Beside the text, a rough sketch of an ice sled is drawn, with a specific symbol that matches the rune on the broken equipment piece.</li>
</ul>
<p>The piece of equipment is a mechanical cog with an embedded rune. Despite its damaged state, it emits a faint, magical aura.</p>
<p><strong>Investigation and Deciphering</strong>:
   - <strong>Intelligence (Investigation) DC 12</strong> Recognize that the note is partially ciphered.
   - <strong>Wisdom (Perception) DC 10</strong> Notice the matching rune symbol on both the note and equipment piece.
   - <strong>Consulting Sammul</strong>:
     - Sammul can assist with the cipher.
     - <strong>Intelligence (Arcana) DC 15</strong> Sammul explains that the symbol is an old rune associated with navigation and frost magic.
   - <strong>Intelligence (History) DC 12</strong> Recognize references to ancient frost magic and artifacts used in Jhed.
   - <strong>Intelligence (Investigation) DC 15</strong> Fully decipher the message in the note.</p>
<p><strong>Deciphered Message</strong>:
   - Indicates that the volunteers are malfunctioning and behaving erratically.
   - Suggests seeking out the Frostfinder, a magical compass, necessary to navigate to Dhuren Tol and find The Frostrunner ice sled.</p>
<p><strong>After Deciphering</strong>:
   - <strong>Information</strong> The deciphered note clearly indicates that the volunteers are failing. The note suggests seeking out the Frostfinder to repair The Frostrunner ice sled.
   - <strong>Guidance</strong> The mention of the Frostfinder gives the party a clear objective. They learn that the Frostfinder can be found in a cave infested with ice trolls, led by Gragnar the Frostbite.
   - <strong>Next Steps</strong>:
     - The party knows they must secure the Frostfinder to navigate effectively and reach Dhuren Tol.
     - The broken equipment piece is a part of The Frostrunner’s navigation system, highlighting the importance of repairing the sled for safe travel.</p>

<p>Players should easily be able to learn that Lizardfolk mostly live in caverns but since they are nomadic there is no central point. There is the Unthil Peaks (2 days east), that have caverns as well as through the Smuggling Route (1 day South). The best way to figure out their location is by asking beasts and humanoids in The J'hed Wilds but let player's come up with clever solutions to how they want to find the clan. If they return to UnderRoc Tower II. it is not gauranteed the Lizardfolk are still there</p>
<h3 id="trial-one-of-combat-93d6-lizardfolk">Trial One: Of Combat 9+3d6 Lizardfolk</h3>
<p>Lizardfolk believe in demonstrations of power, physical or magical so to gain an audiance or respect they first need to know the talent of whom they deal with.</p>
<p>When the players socialize/engage with the Lizardfolk, they will begin to surround them as they speak as one speaks in broken common "How many; fight?". The number the party responds with first, that many Lizardfolk will run in and start a battle, and they intend to kill.</p>
<p>"The moment a number is spoken as if poised for battle, that many Lizardfolk lunge forward with the intent to feast"</p>
<p>Once the party dispatches these Lizardfolk, they will have a short period to ask questions but the Lizardfolk quickly become bored "More, More, Fun, Fun" this time, with a playful attitude they all begin to attack. They will knock the players out at this point rather than deliver a killing blow; if the entire party becomes incapacitated the Lizardfolk will drag them safetly back to Netrus and leave as they earned their respect, the party will gain one exhaustion level.</p>
<p>If the party kills all the Lizardfolk and did not fight playfully, they lose the respect of the Lizardfolk and become hostile unless the party can solve this through clever means</p>
<h3 id="trial-two-of-beast">Trial Two: Of Beast</h3>
<p>Lizardfolk Shaman "Kraw" visits Netrus with a message for the party "Trial, Unthil Peaks, Follow, Days Three"</p>
<p>The party will be lead to Unthil Peaks and up a series of three difficult 40ft climbs. Consider a default Athletics DC13, on a fail they can take 1d6 bludgeoning damage or a point of exhaustion for each cliff, but let players be creative here, grant advantage for teamwork. </p>
<p>"Birds, Ride, Impress" Kraw announces mentioning towards nesting Pternadons. </p>
<p>These tiered cliffs are about 40ft from the ridges below where the Pternadons are. The goal is to stay on the Pteranodon's as long as possible. And the Lizardfolk Shaman just wants to see each member of the party make an attempt to ride the Pteranadons. </p>
<p>Pteranodon</p>
<p>At the start of each turn you make an animal handling check, on a success you can direct the Pteraodon's movement, on a failure it moves randomly and up 10ft
At the end of each turn make a Dexterity Saving Throw or be knocked prone off the Pternadon</p>
<p>After falling, the riden Pternadon will attack the associated player. Once the Trial is complete the Shaman will leave </p>
