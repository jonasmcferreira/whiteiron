# Map/World Logistics


### Path to J'hed

Two months travel from the closest trade point outside of Jhed to nearest tradepost in Jhed

Penninsula and island keys connect to the continent of Jhed

### J'hed Continent

Physically akin to Antarctica for placeholder description

4 small villages to trade at edge of Continent and Wasteland

These towns mark the south most settlements in existence

Continent is lower level zones

Ambitious Kings try to conquer J'hed and beyond and all have failed

### J'hed Wasteland

This is the "frozen ocean" of exploration and source of gold rush

Eratic, unstable and travelling beasts required for longer distances

No maps or known landmarks

Seems lost in time (roll if day or night every short rest)

Blindspots to gods and devils - within the Wasteland, it seems higher entities simply don't see into the wasteland or even believe it exists

A chaotic wilderness, it doesn't make geological sense
