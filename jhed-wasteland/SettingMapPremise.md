# Map/World Logistics

### Path to J'hed

- Two months travel from the closest trade point outside of Jhed to the nearest trade post in Jhed.
- Peninsula and island keys connect to the continent of Jhed.

### J'hed Continent

- Physically akin to Antarctica for placeholder description.
- 4 small villages for trade at the edge of the Continent and Wasteland.
- These towns mark the southernmost settlements in existence.
- The continent is considered lower-level zones.
- Ambitious kings have tried to conquer J'hed and beyond but have all failed.

### J'hed Wasteland

- This is the "frozen ocean" of exploration and the source of a gold rush.
- Erratic, unstable, and traveling beasts are required for longer distances.
- No maps or known landmarks.
- Seems lost in time (roll if day or night every short rest).
- Blindspots to gods and devils - within the Wasteland, it seems higher entities simply don't see into the wasteland or even believe it exists.
- A chaotic wilderness that doesn't make geological sense.
