### Combat

**Actions**:

Multiattack. In whale form, the werewhale makes two attacks, one Bite and one Tail attack. In humanoid form, it makes two spear attacks. In hybrid form, it can attack like a whale or a humanoid.

Bite (Whale or Hybrid Form Only). Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (3d8 + 7) piercing damage. If the target is a small or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by the werewhale. A swallowed creature has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the werewhale, and it takes 3 (1d6) acid damage at the start of each of the werewhale's turns. If the werewhale takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the werewhale must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the whale. If the werewhale dies, a swallowed creature can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting prone. If the target is a humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with werewhale lycanthropy.

**The Gliding Cloud:**

The Gliding Cloud is a marvel of magical engineering, created by the eccentric gnome inventor Fizwidget Gearspanner. Known for his wild ideas and unorthodox methods, Fizwidget was often dismissed as mad. Recognizing Fizwidget's genius, Captain Winterbourne commissioned him to build a ship capable of navigating the treacherous ice and snow of the Jhed Wasteland. Combining mechanical expertise with ancient magical runes, Fizwidget enchanted the ship's hull and keel with a perpetual heating spell, allowing it to melt ice and steam across frozen terrain. Upon completion, the ship was entrusted to Captain Winterbourne, and Fizwidget disappeared into legend.

The ship's hull is reinforced with heat-conducting metal that glows faintly with an inner fire. The keel, the ship's backbone, is enchanted to remain perpetually hot, generating steam and enabling smooth travel over ice and snow.
The sails are flame resistant, they are imbued with fire-resistant enchantments, glowing faintly with an orange hue.
The Gliding Cloud has a small crew, usually around 6 members, enough to operate the vessel efficiently in the small, sparsely populated environment of J'hed.

**The Flaming Fools:**

The crew of the Gliding Cloud, are a hardy group of adventurers. They are fiercely loyal with eccentric personalities, yet their ability to get the job done seems unmatched. Returning Captain Thaddeus to them can create powerful allies
