# Adventures

## Structure Reminder

The default rules for encounters recommend aiming for 6 to 8 medium to deadly encounters per long rest. If you seek a greater challenge, consider using the "Gritty Realism" variant, where a short rest is 8 hours and a long rest is 7 days.

Be mindful that weather is an important factor. Be sure to factor in the weather system.

Encounters with purpose - encounters should:
    - Create conflict
    - Reinforce plot
    - Add intrigue

**Quest:** The party is given a task to escort the caravan to Netrus and apprehend Reylin and "Club" Cory, dead or alive. These two are murderers who are suspected to have fled to Jhed

**Code of Snow:** Sammul the religious leader of Netrus will explain to the party that though their task is lawful, Jhed is a place of new beginnings and that actions taken before someone has reached Jhed are not held against their character. The village of Netrus will even offer the gold reward of the bounty to ignore it.

**Bounty Hunters:** Though bounty hunters act within the law, they are despised by the population of Jhed, disputes should be handled personally. This makes Jhed a home for new beginnings of shady characters
