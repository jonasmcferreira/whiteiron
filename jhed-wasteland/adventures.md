# Adventures

## Structure Reminder

The default rules for encounters recommend aiming for 6 to 8 medium to deadly encounters per long rest. If you seek a greater challenge, consider using the "Gritty Realism" variant, where a short rest is 8 hours and a long rest is 7 days.

Be mindful that weather is an important factor. Be sure to factor in the weather system.

Encounters with purpose - encounters should:
    - Create conflict
    - Reinforce plot
    - Add intrigue

## Lvl One


### UnderRoc Bridge Part 1: First Tower

A sudden halt causes the party to lurch forward; as they steady Don Vras calls back in common "looks suspicious up 'ead". The ice slick smuggling tunnels open to an old but wellmade stone tower. Four figures through the fog are smaller than the expected guards and there is no greeting. A pike with a grey fur banner and two bull horns adorn the opening, the six rams pull at the reign. This was an important spot to resupply
