# Adventures

## Structure Reminder

The default rules for encounters recommend aiming for 6 to 8 medium to deadly encounters per long rest. If you seek a greater challenge, consider using the "Gritty Realism" variant, where a short rest is 8 hours and a long rest is 7 days.

Be mindful that weather is an important factor. Be sure to factor in the weather system.

Encounters with purpose - encounters should:
    - Create conflict
    - Reinforce plot
    - Add intrigue

## Lvl One, Journey To Netrus

Goals.

    Get a feel for 6 to 8 encounter before short rest
    Setup the Gritty Realism resting system (short rest 8 hours, long rest 7 days)
    Encounter Reptiles, Kobolds, Undead, Oozes, Weather and Madness (look 6 encounters)
    
### The Journey

Leaving Thieves Key the party is sheltered on a small covered boat with Don Vras. Two unnamed figures navigate the waters from outside and this opportunity is the last to gain anymore knowledge about Jhed for now. The vessel lists and rocks chaotically on the frigid water for two days before reaching the smuggler's route but there are merryment in drink, meat and fruit.  

The quest? delivering a package to the edge of the world at a time supply routes are cut. 600gp to simply deliver a small 50 lbs package, and any other 20 lbs crate they can bring is another 100gp in rewards. However any crate lost is -150gp, and no reward if the 50 lbs package isn't delivered  

2 day travel on water to smuggler tunnel  
2-3 day travel in tunnel to UnderRoc Bridge
1 day travel tunnel past UnderRoc Bridge
1-2 day travel on snow surface

Crates locked (DC 13), small package locked (DC 16)

### Encounter 1: Ice Wall

Correct to Don Vras' word, the tunnels navigate easily with each splitting direction boarded up, yet light tremors are felt through these caverns. Upon the first rest, the party awakens to a spirit, featureless sitting with them at camp that fades when looked at. 

Boarded Walls - boarded walls are marked with Thieves cant, a rogue investigating can be told the result of the roll before destroying the blockade

The cavern opens up and seems to have sheered the path, causing a 30ft cliff of jagged ice. Ontop a Kobold can be seen for a brief moment (3 total), before they run off (towards the UnderRoc Bridge) with no intention of hindering the party.

### UnderRoc Bridge Part 1: First Tower

A sudden halt causes the party to lurch forward; as they steady Don Vras calls back in common "looks suspicious up 'ead". The ice slick smuggling tunnels open to an old but wellmade stone tower. Four figures through the fog are smaller than the expected guards and there is no greeting. A pike with a grey fur banner and two bull horns adorn the opening, the six rams pull at the reign. This was an important spot to resupply
