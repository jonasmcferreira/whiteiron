# Adventures

## Structure Reminder

The default rules for encounters recommend aiming for 6 to 8 medium to deadly encounters per long rest. If you seek a greater challenge, consider using the "Gritty Realism" variant, where a short rest is 8 hours and a long rest is 7 days.

Be mindful that weather is an important factor. Be sure to factor in the weather system.

Encounters with purpose - encounters should:
    - Create conflict
    - Reinforce plot
    - Add intrigue

## Introduction: Journey To Netrus (lvl 1)

Goals.

    Get a feel for 6 to 8 encounter before short rest
    Setup the Gritty Realism resting system (short rest 8 hours, long rest 7 days)
    Encounter Reptiles, Kobolds, Undead, Oozes, Weather and Madness (look 6 encounters)
    
### The Journey

Leaving Thieves Key the party is sheltered on a small covered boat with Don Vras. Two unnamed figures navigate the waters from outside and this opportunity is the last to gain anymore knowledge about Jhed for now. The vessel lists and rocks chaotically on the frigid water for two days before reaching the smuggler's route but there are merryment in drink, meat and fruit.  

The quest? delivering a package to the edge of the world at a time supply routes are cut. 600gp to simply deliver a small 50 lbs package, and any other 20 lbs crate they can bring is another 100gp in rewards. However any crate lost is -150gp, and no reward if the 50 lbs package isn't delivered  

2 day travel on water to smuggler tunnel  
2-3 day travel in tunnel to UnderRoc Bridge
1 day travel tunnel past UnderRoc Bridge
1-2 day travel on snow surface

Crates locked (DC 13), small package locked (DC 16)

### Encounter: Ice Wall

Correct to Don Vras' word, the tunnels navigate easily with each splitting direction boarded up, yet light tremors are felt through these caverns. Upon the first rest, the party awakens to a spirit, featureless sitting with them at camp that fades when looked at. 

Boarded Walls - boarded walls are marked with Thieves cant, a rogue investigating can be told the result of the roll before destroying the blockade

The cavern opens up and seems to have sheered the path, causing a 25ft cliff of jagged ice. Ontop a Kobold can be seen for a brief moment (3 total), before they run off (towards the UnderRoc Bridge) with no intention of hindering the party.

Climbing the Ice Wall 

1 Piercing Damage represented by the sharp terrain if just using Climb Speed

Athletics Check DC 13, with some assistance (climbing gear, rope)

1d6 bludgeoning damage from fall on failed check, 2d6 bludgeoning damage if failed by 10 or more (3) 

### Encounter: Another Route One

5. Path splits to two, each path is a new D6 and can split again
6. Couple hours down path, Shortcut Puzzle. If the party has already found this, replace it with "Cold" result

### Encounter: Shortcut

The path ends in abandoned excavated ruins of a small room. Rubble and stone strewn about, but an intricate triangular closed door, about 9ft tall. There is no consistent pattern upon the frame or door, but stone brazier carved into it.

Casting a cantrip within 30ft of the door causes it the fail but the door glow as the casters feels the energy of the spell drawn to it. Brandishing a magic item will have a similar effect but not remove the magical properties of the item

**Bounty Hunters:** Though bounty hunters act within the law, they are despised by the population of Jhed, disputes should be handled personally. This makes Jhed a home for new beginnings of shady characters

**Ascended Kobold:**

    Twice per long rest: bless, inflict wounds

**Plots:**

## Level Two Adventure: Securing the Ice Sled

### Adventure Outline: "The Lost Volunteer"

### Introduction

**Hook**: While the party is in Netrus, a wandering undead laborer, known as a "volunteer," stumbles into the village, lost and in disrepair. The appearance of this undead worker, typically found only in Dhuren Tol, raises concern among the villagers and curiosity in the party.

### Act 1: The Lost Volunteer

#### The Volunteer’s Arrival

As the party goes about their business in the bustling village of Netrus, a sudden commotion draws their attention. Villagers gather, whispering and pointing, as a disoriented figure shuffles into view from the edge of the settlement. It’s an undead laborer, known locally as a "volunteer," but this one seems far from the efficient worker it should be.

The volunteer's movements are erratic, its skeletal frame visibly damaged, with bones jutting out at odd angles and a missing arm. Its eyes, dull and lifeless, seem to flicker with a faint, unnatural light. A tattered cloak hangs loosely from its shoulders, fluttering in the cold wind as it stumbles towards the party.

In its remaining hand, the volunteer clutches a crumpled piece of parchment and a peculiar, broken piece of equipment. The parchment, stained and torn, bears cryptic writing and symbols. The equipment, though damaged, still emits a faint aura of magic, hinting at its once important function.

Nick Ugris, the towering Hill Giant leader of Netrus, approaches with a frown etched deeply into his weathered face. "This is not good," he mutters, more to himself than anyone else. Beside him, Sammul, the wise Tortle Runepriest, studies the volunteer with a mix of curiosity and concern.

As the volunteer collapses to the ground, its head jerking spasmodically, Sammul carefully retrieves the note and the broken equipment. He looks up at the party, his eyes serious. "This volunteer is from Dhuren Tol. Something must be terribly wrong for it to end up here in such a state. We need to decipher these clues and find out what’s happening."

Nick nods, his massive hand gently patting the volunteer’s bony shoulder. "You lot," he says, addressing the party, "seems like you’re just the right folks to get to the bottom of this. Let’s see what we can make of these clues and get you ready for the journey ahead."

#### Deciphering the Clues

The note clutched in the skeleton's hand is dirty with mud and coal dust, but no blood. On reading it, a common person will understand the urgent title and the rune, but everything else will look like arcane script, a little fuzzy and symbolic, rather than writing. The note reads:

   - Text:
     ```
     Volunteers are going bonkers. Need the Frostfinder to fix The Frostrunner. 
     Key: [symbol of a snowflake with a rune in the center]
     P.S. Watch out for the trolls. They don’t like visitors.
     ```
Beside the text, a rough sketch of an ice sled is drawn, with a specific symbol that matches the rune on the broken equipment piece.

The piece of equipment is a mechanical cog with an embedded rune. Despite its damaged state, it emits a faint, magical aura.

**Investigation and Deciphering**:
   - **Intelligence (Investigation) DC 12**: Recognize that the note is partially ciphered.
   - **Wisdom (Perception) DC 10**: Notice the matching rune symbol on both the note and equipment piece.
   - **Consulting Sammul**:
     - Sammul can assist with the cipher.
     - **Intelligence (Arcana) DC 15**: Sammul explains that the symbol is an old rune associated with navigation and frost magic.
   - **Intelligence (History) DC 12**: Recognize references to ancient frost magic and artifacts used in Jhed.
   - **Intelligence (Investigation) DC 15**: Fully decipher the message in the note.

**Deciphered Message**:
   - Indicates that the volunteers are malfunctioning and behaving erratically.
   - Suggests seeking out the Frostfinder, a magical compass, necessary to navigate to Dhuren Tol and find The Frostrunner ice sled.

**After Deciphering**:
   - **Information**: The deciphered note clearly indicates that the volunteers are failing. The note suggests seeking out the Frostfinder to repair The Frostrunner ice sled.
   - **Guidance**: The mention of the Frostfinder gives the party a clear objective. They learn that the Frostfinder can be found in a cave infested with ice trolls, led by Gragnar the Frostbite.
   - **Next Steps**:
     - The party knows they must secure the Frostfinder to navigate effectively and reach Dhuren Tol.
     - The broken equipment piece is a part of The Frostrunner’s navigation system, highlighting the importance of repairing the sled for safe travel.

### Act 2: Securing the Ice Sled

   - The party is tasked with finding and securing an ice sled necessary for the journey to Dhuren Tol.

   - Thoren asks the party to retrieve the Frostfinder, a valuable magical compass, from a nearby cave infested with ice trolls.

3. **Retrieving the Frostfinder**:
   - The party ventures to the cave, navigating traps and battling ice trolls led by Gragnar the Frostbite.
   - They retrieve the Frostfinder and return to Netrus.

4. **Locating the Ice Sled**:
   - With Thoren Coldwind's information, the party sets out to find the lost ice sled, "The Frostrunner."
   - They face environmental challenges such as blizzards and unstable ice, and possibly an encounter with a roc.

5. **Preparing the Ice Sled**:
   - Upon finding The Frostrunner, the party needs to prepare it for the journey. Depending on their skills and resources, they can choose to:
     - **Pull by Dogs**: If they can handle animals and have access to sled dogs.
     - **Push by Hand**: If they lack animals but have enough strength and manpower.
     - **Pull by People**: If they prefer to pull it themselves, utilizing their teamwork and endurance.

### Act 3: Journey to Dhuren Tol

1. **Setting Off**:
   - The party sets off in The Frostrunner, navigating the harsh terrain of the Jhed Wasteland.
   - They encounter various challenges, such as snowstorms, wandering beasts, and environmental hazards.

2. **The Road to Dhuren Tol**:

   - They might also encounter travelers or villagers in need, offering side quests and additional context.

3. **Arriving in Dhuren Tol**:

## Missing Scouts

A peak to the southeast had veteran scouts not return (party of 6). It is not uncommon for people to go missing in J'hed but an entire squad of veterans this close, odd.   
  
### Ridge Point - 3 day journey

A stone juts by a ridge giving an easy vantage point for the surrounding area. A difficult climb brings you to a plateau with 1 dead body (not zombie), looking around there is a cave entrance recently dug out.  
  
Walking through it (doesn't seem to match geography), will find 3 more bodies before two insane guards are left. They are almost praying at the wall, an old carved doorway and the eyes of all the guards are on the floor. They become hostile and when killed become a hostile shadow

Door Puzzle? or Mcguffin to get in
