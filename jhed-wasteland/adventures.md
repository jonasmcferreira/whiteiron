# Adventures

## Structure Reminder

The default rules for encounters recommend aiming for 6 to 8 medium to deadly encounters per long rest. If you seek a greater challenge, consider using the "Gritty Realism" variant, where a short rest is 8 hours and a long rest is 7 days.

Be mindful that weather is an important factor. Be sure to factor in the weather system.

Encounters with purpose - encounters should:

    - Create conflict
    - Reinforce plot
    - Add intrigue

## Introduction: Journey To Netrus (lvl 1)

Goals.

    Get a feel for 6 to 8 encounter before short rest
    Setup the Gritty Realism resting system (short rest 8 hours, long rest 7 days)
    Encounter Reptiles, Kobolds, Undead, Oozes, Weather and Madness (look 6 encounters)

Leaving Thieves Key the party is sheltered on a small covered boat with Don Vras. Two unnamed figures navigate the waters from outside and this opportunity is the last to gain anymore knowledge about Jhed for now. The vessel lists and rocks chaotically on the frigid water for two days before reaching the smuggler's route but there are merryment in drink, meat and fruit.  




### Session Zero

The quest? delivering a package to the edge of the world at a time supply routes are cut. 600gp to simply deliver a small 50 lbs package, and any other 20 lbs crate they can bring is another 100gp in rewards. However any crate lost is -150gp, and no reward if the 50 lbs package isn't delivered. The last courier team to Netrus has gone missing  

Thieves Key

### Intro

2 day travel on water to smuggler tunnel

1 day travel on smuggler tunnel river

### Step 1:

1-2 day travel in tunnel to UnderRoc Bridge (2 days if stealth, 1 day if normal pace)

The frozen path follows a gentle incline, centered on two rails but there is no light further ahead

#### Encounter 1a: Boarded Walls 

DM note: this is meant as a bypass to "A Wall of Ice" if players explore early or fail to get up

Each time Boarded walls are marked with Thieves cant, a rogue investigating can be told the result of the roll before destroying the blockade. Each path must be travelled for about 30 minutes before the result happens

Reference Image: IceCave

| D6 | Behind Wall |
|----|-------------|
| 1  | Too Cold    |
| 2  | Trap        |
| 3  | Dead        |
| 4  | Danger Hole |
| 5  | Split       |
| 6  | Bypass   |

1. The path is long and cold, 1 Cold Damage as you travel
2. Investigation Check (DC10) to notice trap: Dexterity Save (DC10) 1d4 Bludgeoning Damage as roof caves in, impassible
3. A corpse slumped to the ground wearing scraps (Zombie): Party is surprised if move towards
4. Half eaten Kobold near a deep hole. Investigation 13: water in the hole. Can be Lizardfolk ambush
5. Path splits to two, each path is a new D6 and can split again
6. Hour down path, the pass returns to the main route allowing you to bypass an obstacle

#### Ghost of the Past 

DM note: Ghost of the Past never speaks more than one sentence, always cryptic

**Trigger**: after the party wakes from their first short rest

**An ethereal form, barely visible through refractions of light in the ice sits aside your camp. "Will you be any different?" the cavernous wind speaks in an old common.**   

The form fades away without interacting

#### Encounter 1b: A Wall of Ice

DM note: quick simple obstacle

The cavern opens wide with chunks of debris stacking up to 15ft slumped along a wall of ice. As if the passage was split by an immense tremor. The top of this wall of jagged ice seems 25ft above the highest pile of debris and a Kobold (two others hidden) can be seen taking interest before running off

1 Piercing Damage to Climb the Wall of Ice represented by the sharp terrain if just using Climb Speed

Athletics Check DC 13 to Climb, with some assistance and no climb speed (climbing gear, rope, pitons)

1d6 Bludgeoning Damage from fall on failed check, 2d6 bludgeoning damage if failed by 10 or more (3). This represents falling at the 10ft point, or 20ft point

You can make this more challenging by making Kobolds hide and shove (or cut rope) characters when they reach the top

| Check         | DC | Result                                        | DC | Result                              |
|---------------|----|-----------------------------------------------|----|-------------------------------------|
| Athletics        | 13 | on fail, 1d6 Bludgeoning damage                           | 3 | 2d6 Bludgeoning Damage             |
| Survival       | 13 | Climbable wall, but will hurt a bit              |    |                                     |
| Perception    | 16  | Shadows of Kobolds hint they are moving away |  |                                     |
| Investigation | 13 | Tracks lead back, and go into Boarded Walls (bypass)   |  |  |



#### Encounter 1c: Kresh and Krew

DM note: Use this option if party is stuck

The faint sound of iron against ice echoes before stalagtites above you buckles and breaks. Three hulking Lizardfolk fall from above.  
  
They only speak Draconic, but clearly have climbing gear, tools and will help the party for trade through gestures if no party member speaks draconic  
  
Kresh and Krew won't stick around to help the party further and dig down to the waters

Lizardfolk names should all start with "Kr"

#### Encounter 2: Remnants of the Trade Party

As the main tunnel forks, a Boarded Wall to the left is smashed open with trails of blood leading in both directions

Just a little past the Boarded Wall, tucked in an alcove is a makeshift wooden barrier with a few corpses (6) scattered about wearing tattered clothing of the Outer Empire. They have no weapons, armor or gold, as if picked clean, though it appears something taking large bites from the bodies (something Giant sized and smaller bites too)

If the party moves closer or investigates around the bodies 2-4 Zombies will surprise them

**Oniteth Scouter** - Female Goliath (frost) Survivor 

DM note: avoid giving another NPC a glaive

Behind the makeshift wooden barrier and through a crawlspace Oniteth is hidding, and will make his presence known calling for help. Oniteth is gaunt looking as if close to death, shaking while gripping his glaive (he will not give it up). Oniteth wears the garment of the Outer Empire

"Apologies and thank you, I hate it but I can't handle the frontline now. I have an important letter for Nick Elder of Netrus it is the only thing I could safeguard"

"I was stationed at UnderRoc searching for this group, something Giant started thrashing me about and I just took where I couldn't be grabbed"

|Medicine  |10 | Oniteth is Exhausted | 13 | Remnants of poison (unknown) powder on the dead   |

**Hostile:** will cast charm person / sleep / gaseous form to escape

#### Encounter 3a: UnderRoc Tower

DM Note: A series of 3 combats in one. Stay in initiative order, and if players don't act after 3 rounds, the Kobolds will act. Kobold's in J'hed should always involve traps. Kobold's will always attack to gain pact tactics and retreat when 1 is left
  
Charisma Checks Disadvantage if not using Draconic with Kobolds

| Weather | Normal | Lightly Obscure | Heavily Obscure |

The stone tower to the left is built into the icy cliffs, it appears to be two floors with arrow slits and vantage points. Domed and covered at the top 

**Bridge Entrance** 

Kobolds would rather complete a trade and run away. They search for food, treasures and dragons

Squeezing through a tight corridor leads underneath the UnderRoc bridge revealing a hidden yet very intentional passage through the middle that can be crawled through. The stonework can be almost too clean
  
Investigation Check DC13: The stonework seems to be washed by acid

Grey Ooze: moving along the corridor is a grey ooze, a still oil slick patch of wet stone and will attack when the party crosses. 

Attack the highest hitpoint target as the ooze 3d6+1 damage and can crit. If the party wants the campaign to be difficult simply attack the who is leading the party

    Dispersing Green Haze: Constitution Save DC 7, poisoned on a failure for 8 hours.

    4 Bodies around a broken caravan, once the party investigates they attack
    
    2 zombies, 2 skeletons
    
    A horse per round charges through the fog charging attacking and running away
    
    3 warhorse skeletons
    
    There is dead kobolds all around the bridge (Kobolds were fighting the undead)
    
    Investigation Check DC 13: There is residue of a powerful poison and the Green Haze
    
    Just like most Kobold fights should involve traps, undead fights should involve poison

### Encounter 4: Open Wasteland

    Brush with large deep blue "berries" 1d4

    Attacked by 1d4 poisonous snake, and 1 giant poisonous snake 

    These berries are important and grow randomly through Jhed

**Code of Snow:** Sammul the religious leader of Netrus will explain to the party that though their task is lawful, Jhed is a place of new beginnings and that actions taken before someone has reached Jhed are not held against their character. The village of Netrus will even offer the gold reward of the bounty to ignore it.

**Bounty Hunters:** Though bounty hunters act within the law, they are despised by the population of Jhed, disputes should be handled personally. This makes Jhed a home for new beginnings of shady characters

**Ascended Kobold:**

    Twice per long rest: bless, inflict wounds

**Plots:**

## Level Two Adventure: Securing the Ice Sled

### Adventure Outline: "The Lost Volunteer"

### Introduction

**Hook**: While the party is in Netrus, a wandering undead laborer, known as a "volunteer," stumbles into the village, lost and in disrepair. The appearance of this undead worker, typically found only in Dhuren Tol, raises concern among the villagers and curiosity in the party.

### Act 1: The Lost Volunteer

#### The Volunteer’s Arrival

As the party goes about their business in the bustling village of Netrus, a sudden commotion draws their attention. Villagers gather, whispering and pointing, as a disoriented figure shuffles into view from the edge of the settlement. It’s an undead laborer, known locally as a "volunteer," but this one seems far from the efficient worker it should be.

The volunteer's movements are erratic, its skeletal frame visibly damaged, with bones jutting out at odd angles and a missing arm. Its eyes, dull and lifeless, seem to flicker with a faint, unnatural light. A tattered cloak hangs loosely from its shoulders, fluttering in the cold wind as it stumbles towards the party.

In its remaining hand, the volunteer clutches a crumpled piece of parchment and a peculiar, broken piece of equipment. The parchment, stained and torn, bears cryptic writing and symbols. The equipment, though damaged, still emits a faint aura of magic, hinting at its once important function.

Nick Ugris, the towering Hill Giant leader of Netrus, approaches with a frown etched deeply into his weathered face. "This is not good," he mutters, more to himself than anyone else. Beside him, Sammul, the wise Tortle Runepriest, studies the volunteer with a mix of curiosity and concern.

As the volunteer collapses to the ground, its head jerking spasmodically, Sammul carefully retrieves the note and the broken equipment. He looks up at the party, his eyes serious. "This volunteer is from Dhuren Tol. Something must be terribly wrong for it to end up here in such a state. We need to decipher these clues and find out what’s happening."

Nick nods, his massive hand gently patting the volunteer’s bony shoulder. "You lot," he says, addressing the party, "seems like you’re just the right folks to get to the bottom of this. Let’s see what we can make of these clues and get you ready for the journey ahead."

#### Deciphering the Clues

The note clutched in the skeleton's hand is dirty with mud and coal dust, but no blood. On reading it, a common person will understand the urgent title and the rune, but everything else will look like arcane script, a little fuzzy and symbolic, rather than writing. The note reads:

   - Text:
     ```
     Volunteers are going bonkers. Need the Frostfinder to fix The Frostrunner. 
     Key: [symbol of a snowflake with a rune in the center]
     P.S. Watch out for the trolls. They don’t like visitors.
     ```
Beside the text, a rough sketch of an ice sled is drawn, with a specific symbol that matches the rune on the broken equipment piece.

The piece of equipment is a mechanical cog with an embedded rune. Despite its damaged state, it emits a faint, magical aura.

**Investigation and Deciphering**:
   - **Intelligence (Investigation) DC 12**: Recognize that the note is partially ciphered.
   - **Wisdom (Perception) DC 10**: Notice the matching rune symbol on both the note and equipment piece.
   - **Consulting Sammul**:
     - Sammul can assist with the cipher.
     - **Intelligence (Arcana) DC 15**: Sammul explains that the symbol is an old rune associated with navigation and frost magic.
   - **Intelligence (History) DC 12**: Recognize references to ancient frost magic and artifacts used in Jhed.
   - **Intelligence (Investigation) DC 15**: Fully decipher the message in the note.

**Deciphered Message**:
   - Indicates that the volunteers are malfunctioning and behaving erratically.
   - Suggests seeking out the Frostfinder, a magical compass, necessary to navigate to Dhuren Tol and find The Frostrunner ice sled.

**After Deciphering**:
   - **Information**: The deciphered note clearly indicates that the volunteers are failing. The note suggests seeking out the Frostfinder to repair The Frostrunner ice sled.
   - **Guidance**: The mention of the Frostfinder gives the party a clear objective. They learn that the Frostfinder can be found in a cave infested with ice trolls, led by Gragnar the Frostbite.
   - **Next Steps**:
     - The party knows they must secure the Frostfinder to navigate effectively and reach Dhuren Tol.
     - The broken equipment piece is a part of The Frostrunner’s navigation system, highlighting the importance of repairing the sled for safe travel.

### Act 2: Securing the Ice Sled

1. **Finding the Ice Sled**:
   - The party is tasked with finding and securing an ice sled necessary for the journey to Dhuren Tol.
   - They learn that Thoren Coldwind, a trader in Netrus, has information about a durable ice sled prepared for Jhed.

2. **Negotiating for Information**:
   - The party negotiates with Thoren Coldwind, who agrees to provide the location of the ice sled in exchange for a favor or a trade.
   - Thoren asks the party to retrieve the Frostfinder, a valuable magical compass, from a nearby cave infested with ice trolls.

3. **Retrieving the Frostfinder**:
   - The party ventures to the cave, navigating traps and battling ice trolls led by Gragnar the Frostbite.
   - They retrieve the Frostfinder and return to Netrus.

4. **Locating the Ice Sled**:
   - With Thoren Coldwind's information, the party sets out to find the lost ice sled, "The Frostrunner."
   - They face environmental challenges such as blizzards and unstable ice, and possibly an encounter with a roc.

5. **Preparing the Ice Sled**:
   - Upon finding The Frostrunner, the party needs to prepare it for the journey. Depending on their skills and resources, they can choose to:
     - **Pull by Dogs**: If they can handle animals and have access to sled dogs.
     - **Push by Hand**: If they lack animals but have enough strength and manpower.
     - **Pull by People**: If they prefer to pull it themselves, utilizing their teamwork and endurance.

### Act 3: Journey to Dhuren Tol

1. **Setting Off**:
   - The party sets off in The Frostrunner, navigating the harsh terrain of the Jhed Wasteland.
   - They encounter various challenges, such as snowstorms, wandering beasts, and environmental hazards.
