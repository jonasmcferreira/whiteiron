# Monster Types

players should be warned general when building characters and making choices
at Dinosuar

Dungeon masters should not be afraid of using staple monster types. Plenty of spells and effects are aimed at humanoids undead beasts and the like. So the party's cleric destroys your undead, send another wave before allowing them to rest and you'll see him burn through his spell slots. Wizard uses silvery barbs constantly, interrupt the short and long rests with more encounters.

Characters have the ability so give them the chance for them to use them. It's at the edge of the resources available that the players will get more creative and more fun to play with.
