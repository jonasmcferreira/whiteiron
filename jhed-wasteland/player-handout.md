The continent of Jhed is a southern snowscape surrounded in mystery of missing Kings. A few barely populated villages with denizens willing to endure the brutal landscape for their own ends. But the Jhed Wasteland, an ocean of tundra is where the treasure hunters go. Unmapped, unconquered and the ones that return make great wealths in their short journey, those that stay too long have gone missing.  

Recently news of earthquakes in Jhed causing chaos and discovery have been rumored through sailors and adventurers, now is the first wave of opportunity.
