The continent of Jhed is a southern snowscape surrounded in mystery of missing Kings. A few barely populated villages with denizens willing to endure the brutal landscape for their own ends. But the Jhed Wasteland, an ocean of tundra is where the treasure hunters go. Unmapped, unconquered and the ones that return make great wealths in their short journey, those that stay too long have gone missing.
