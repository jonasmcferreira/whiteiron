### Plot Hooks & Revelations

- Yuan-ti pilgrimage to a great truth, but Naga prevent this.
- Lizardfolk attempt to hunt and tame the Dinosaurs.

### Kings of Jhed

The failures of the Kings of Jhed are all uncollected burials. These kings were fighters with their own collection of powerful relics, some able to change the course of war and politics

### Crafting

### Design Purpose

- Cold-blooded creatures should make this environment feel odd and stand out from a typical arctic setting.
- Tie in a local important flora (fruit that needs a name). Think of these plants as oases within a desert, useful for potion crafting too.
- All the creatures are looking for something in the wasteland, which there are no records of existing.
