## Cold Blooded Beasts

Why so many Cold Blooded creatures

### Odd Inhabitants

- Kobolds
- Lizardfolk
- Yuan-ti
- Giant Snakes
- Dinosaurs
- Dragonborn (not unusual)
- Dragons???
- Naga
- Tortle

### Dinosaurs

- Lizardfolk want to tame dinosaurs for mounts
- Kobolds see them as false dragons and eat them
- Prized possession for traders
- Only found in Jhed Wasteland

### Plot Hooks & Revelations

- It should be made obvious that this isn't normal.
- A local fruit (rare) grants cold resistance when consumed over long periods of time. It is a potion reagent.
- Kobolds venture to find a dragon (there have been no dragon sightings in known history).
- Yuan-ti pilgrimage to a great truth, but Naga prevent this.
- Lizardfolk attempt to hunt and tame the Dinosaurs.

## Smugger's Route

Poison Crafting for the poison master

## Kings of Jhed

The failures of the Kings of Jhed are all uncollected burials. These kings were fighters with their own collection of powerful relics, some able to change the course of war and politics

## Crafting

There is a primal arcane crafting ability in some areas of Jhed that the Council Five wanted to use and left some basic instructions for. It is not safe, but Jhed is for the risk takers

## Traveling Warp

There are doorways to fast travel through Jhed, how to use them, where they are, where they go and who left them

### Design Purpose

- Cold-blooded creatures should make this environment feel odd and stand out from a typical arctic setting.
- Tie in a local important flora (fruit that needs a name). Think of these plants as oases within a desert, useful for potion crafting too.
- All the creatures are looking for something in the wasteland, which there are no records of existing.
Rude the gas replication failed twice

## Sphynx

Sphynx needs to be guarding something important, and wants a crown from one of the kings of Jhed

### Default Monster Manual Fluff

- Naga and Yuan-ti hate each other

### Revelations of Jhed

- There are a lot of powerful monsters that would often be considered "evil", something about the Jhed Continent tames them. There is this lure of power to go deeper and visit the Wasteland, but a base instinct tells them to stop and take a break

### First ones - oozes

- relics from before any known civilization
- relates to madness, and gaining madness is required to interact with
