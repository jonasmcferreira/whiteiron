# Encounters

## The Poison Merchant

Vez'yen is a reclusive poison merchant found at the entrance of an abandoned mine. This encounter tests the party's resilience and wits through various challenges involving poison.

When the party arrives for the first time, the entrance to the abandoned mine is dark and foreboding. Inside, the party finds a small, empty storage shed. Within the shed are a bell and two cups placed on a dusty table.

The cups contain a mild poison which is sweet to the smell. Anyone who drinks from them must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they are poisoned for 24 hours.

Ringing the bell will alert Vez'yen, an old drow with pock-marked skin, approximately 600 years old who usually is further into the mine, in his hidden laboratory.

While waiting for Vez'yen, the party is exposed to toxic fumes, as a strong chemical smell seems to permeate the air. Each member must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they take 3d6 poison damage, or half as much on a successful save.

Vez'yen's demeanor is enigmatic and slightly sinister, adding to the tension of the encounter. Despite his mysterious nature, Vez'yen is still a merchant, so he prefers if the party succeeds and becomes his customer.

Vez'yen challenges the party to a test of mind. Each participant must take a shot of a potent poison and make a DC 13 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, they suffer 3d6 psychic damage and are rendered unconscious for six seconds.

### Outcome

- If the party successfully overcomes the challenges, Vez'yen becomes a valuable resource. He can:
  - Provide a variety of common poisons.
  - Identify unknown poisons brought to him.
  - Offer gold for creatures that can produce poison, encouraging the party to hunt specific beasts.

### Additional Notes

- The mine and the surrounding area have additional hidden entrances and escape routes that Vez'yen frequently uses.
- If the party decides to attack Vez'yen, he will quickly slide into a secret trapdoor and go deeper into the mine, releasing a burst of toxic cloud into the mine entrance where the players are. Each player must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they fall unconscious for 2d4 hours; on a success, they take 3d8 poison damage. If they all fall unconscious, Vez'yen will take gold from the party and leave them at the entrance with a note explaining that he took money for the damages. His prices will go up until they complete a task for him.

## Emeal "Snowfur" The Tax Man

### Rakshasa

Using the form of an almost Giant White WereTiger, a disguise close to his form to avoid suspicion. He dutifully travels from village to village collecting the taxes for the Noble Seat of Jhed, charismatic and boastful always wanting to throw a few punches or claws. 

### Companion - Eth "Snowcale"

White scaled Lizardfolk Cleric - extremely suspicious looking and used to blame any magical phenomenon around Whitefur

### Brawl

Snowfur will always boastfully challenge people to a two round duel, rules are just doing the most damage in two rounds. This is going to apply the curse of the Rakshasa as he delights in the torment of others

### If discovered

Snowfur will explain that Jhed is evil and he has no ambitions beyond the tax collector, and though he delights in the torment of his victims, by dueling in towns they are always able to be aided even by Snowscale

### If hostile

Snowfur will flee and explain that he will torment, harass party when weak, and steal from them. Even saving them when they are about to die, just so he can collect more taxes from them and prove his utter superiority.

## Snakes!

There is space on the snow where it seems like there is a crate or a chest something of interest to the players. As the players come close the floors starts moving and snake jumps out and bites the nearest. Player the idea is that if the players stay in the same place then snakes will keep popping out of the ground and attacking which means that the players will have to ready actions to hit the snakes. Once all snakes are dead they can safely explore the chest that was buried and served as the decoy for the trap.

White **Giant Poisonous Snakes** 1

White **Poisonous Snakes** 1d4

The chest is empty.

Dunelike snowdrifts battered by strong winds makes each step into the deep crunching snow heavier than the last. A pile of bodies or clothing is spotted in the distance
Passive Perception 13: for just a moment, one of the ripples of snow seemed to move
Active Perception Check 16: at 30ft, some snow shifts and grey scales move  
Animal Handling 16 (only Active Perception Passed): staying still might make the snakes move by

Can be harvested for 1 vial of simple poison, or a stronger poison if brought to poison vendor

## Scroll Burners (will flesh out)

Random Encounters that punish hoarding will encourage adventurers to use what they have and function as a trigger to remind people what they have

A spirit of a pyromancer tasked to set fire to those hoarding arcane scrolls. Their only acceptable locations being designated mage towers. A ghost that is kind and maybe willing to trade information to take the scrolls but will not be refused her orders. Drawn to the locked magical abilities suffused to paper it tugs at her remaining essence.

She warns the party that if she is defeated her master will find them

4 Ghosts

First Appears when party has 3 scrolls

Posesses party member and burns all their scrolls at 6

## Tower Coil

Concept: Straight forward mad dash to the center. Should be difficult without any preperations, but through buffs, resistances or overleveling, or speed boosts the tower is accessible

1,200ft radius crater with a tower in the middle. Functions as a flat and featureless snowdrift with just a 10ft cliff around. Lightning is arcing throughout the crater

When any creature moves into the 1,200ft radius crater roll initiative. The tower will make 3 spell attacks against the party (not needing line of sight) with a +7 to hit dealing 1d12 Lightning Damage on a hit. It will target 3 seperate targets and cannot strike the same target multiple times.

Within the tower you can reset the tower to avoid targets Arcana Check: DC 16

This could be used as a power source for a village

## The Jinxed Hound

### Setup
While traveling through the desolate, snow-covered landscape of Jhed, the party stumbles upon a large, shaggy dog. The creature is slightly larger than a typical mastiff, with the appearance of a wolf but the demeanor of a loyal hunting dog. The dogâ€™s fur is matted with ice and snow, and it looks thin and malnourished. Despite this, it wags its tail energetically as the party approaches, clearly seeking companionship.

### Behavior
The dog seems eager to help the party, offering companionship and even guiding them towards shelter or helping find food. However, after the dog joins the party, strange things start to happen.

### Bad Luck Effects

#### Increased Encounter Frequency
The presence of the dog seems to draw trouble. Roll for random encounters more frequently while the dog is with the party. You can subtly increase the chances of encounters without explicitly stating it's due to the dog. For example, narrate how the dogâ€™s barking might have attracted attention or how it unwittingly led the party into an ambush.

#### Subtle Skill Check Failures
Whenever a party member attempts a skill check, thereâ€™s a chance something goes wrong, even on a successful roll. For example:
- If a character succeeds on a Stealth check, narrate how the dogâ€™s tail knocks over a stack of rocks, making noise that could draw attention.
- On a successful Survival check to find food, the dog might eagerly dig up the cache, ruining some of the supplies in its excitement.

#### Mild Equipment Mishaps
Describe minor issues with the party's equipment. A bowstring might snap, a waterskin could develop a leak, or a torch might inexplicably extinguish. These arenâ€™t serious issues but can become annoyances that hinder the party over time.

#### Misdirection
The dog might lead the party in the wrong direction or misinterpret their commands, causing them to lose time or take a longer route. For example, while trying to guide them to shelter, the dog might bring them to an abandoned lair of some creature, leading to an unexpected encounter.

#### Supernatural Misfortune
Strange occurrences start happening when the dog is around. Weapons might inexplicably miss when they should have hit, or a successful attack might do minimum damage. These can be explained away as "bad rolls" but are, in fact, influenced by the dogâ€™s presence. You could even drop subtle hints, like the dogâ€™s shadow behaving oddly or its footprints occasionally disappearing.

### Resolution

The party might start to suspect the dog is the source of their misfortune, but the dogâ€™s helpful nature makes it difficult to simply abandon it. If they decide to investigate, a **Wisdom (Insight) check DC 15** might reveal that the dog seems oddly out of place in the harsh environment and that its presence coincides with their increasing bad luck.

If the party chooses to get rid of the dog (by leaving it behind, scaring it away, etc.), their luck gradually returns to normal. However, if they persist in keeping the dog, they might eventually uncover its true nature. The dog might be cursed or the embodiment of a trickster spirit, drawn to those who display kindness even in adversity.

### Optional Twist

The dog might be bound to the party until they perform a specific task or ritual to lift its curse. This could lead to a side quest where the party must seek out an ancient hermit or a forgotten shrine in Jhed to break the curse and free the dog and themselves from the bad luck.

The key is to keep the "bad luck" elements subtle and interwoven with the narrative, making them feel like natural occurrences rather than direct penalties.

## The pointing volunteers

As the party treks through the harsh and desolate landscape towards Dhuren Tol, they suddenly spot two figures in the distance. As they draw closer, they realize the figures are, in fact, two skeletal"volunteers"â€”the animated remains of former inhabitants of the wasteland. These undead, unlike the hostile ones the party may have encountered before, seem oddly non-threatening, standing side by side, rhythmically waving their bony arms and pointing in a single direction.

The two volunteers stand about 50 feet apart on either side of the path. Every few seconds, they lift their arms, point emphatically in the direction of Dhuren Tol, then lower their arms againâ€”only to repeat the motion, over and over again, as if caught in an endless loop. They don't speak or make any other movements, just the same eerie, mechanical pointing.

From a distance, this scene looks almost comicalâ€”two skeletons, like bizarre tour guides, endlessly gesturing toward the path ahead. However, their stiff, repetitive actions and the fact that theyâ€™re clearly undead add an unsettling, creepy vibe to the encounter.

The party faces a dilemma: The skeletons are clearly undead, and in most cases, undead are enemies. However, these volunteers are acting more like harmless automatons, just pointing the way. The party must decide:
- Do they follow the direction the volunteers are pointing?
- Do they interact with the skeletons, possibly breaking their endless loop?
- Or do they destroy the undead, assuming they might be a trap or just an abomination?

### Investigating the Volunteers

- **Perception Check DC 14:** The skeletons are making no hostile movements, and their actions seem harmless, albeit strange.
- **Arcana Check DC 14:** The volunteers appear to be under a simple, rudimentary form of necromancy, likely left to perform this task indefinitely. The magic isnâ€™t malevolentâ€”more like a programmed behavior.
- **Insight Check DC 16:** Thereâ€™s no malice in their movements, but something about their endless task feels pitiful, as though they were once given a purpose and now know nothing else.

### Possible Outcomes

- **Following the Direction:** If the party follows the direction the volunteers are pointing, theyâ€™ll find that the path indeed leads toward Dhuren Tol. However, the path is also filled with natural obstaclesâ€”treacherous ice, deep snow drifts, etc. The skeletons seem to be directing them towards the safest route, but itâ€™s still not without challenges. Detract 1d4 days travel to Dhuren Tol.

- **Attempt to Communicate (Charisma Check DC 14):** The skeletons might briefly stop their pointing and move their jaw as if speaking a few words, but nothing comes out of their mouths and then they return to their endless pointing. If asked to guide the party, the skeletons will start walking ahead of the group, continuing to point the way but still in a mechanical, repetitive manner.

- **Dispelling the Magic (Dispel Magic or similar effect):** If the party dispels the magic animating the skeletons, theyâ€™ll crumble into piles of bones, their task finally ended. However, this also means the party loses the guidance and must find their own way through the wasteland.

- **Destroying the Skeletons:** If the party chooses to destroy the volunteers, they will find that the skeletons make no attempt to defend themselves. After being destroyed, the remain stay to be consumed by Jhed

## Animated Spells

Incorperating how players can learn spells, rather than them just picking them, you can have them fight an entity that imbues their power into the caster

The weather of Jhed even manifests the power of magic as an entity

Stats: TBD
Type Elemental

Casts a spell of X per round. Example an arcane missle Animated Spell will simply cast a lvl 1 arcane missle each round.

These elementals are not sentient but simply created in moments due to weather of Jhed. These could also be enslaved and they last until killed or weather changes

## The Mill - two days from Netrus

Last used by Twin Kings, built Zeltrin empire. Three stories, atop a lonely hill along a windswept valley.

### Encounter - Approach the mill

All ranged attacks miss due to heavy wind

Werewolf (bounty) - only damaged by silvered weapons or spells through silvered spell focus

will retreat to mill if wounded

### Encounter - Inside Mill

2 Werewolves - first will turn back to human and act wounded in the Mill asking for help and to be left alone. Second Werewolf will attack if the party doesn't leave
