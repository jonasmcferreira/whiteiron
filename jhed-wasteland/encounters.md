# Encounters

## The Poison Merchant

Vez'yen is a reclusive poison merchant found at the entrance of an abandoned mine. This encounter tests the party's resilience and wits through various challenges involving poison.

When the party arrives for the first time, the entrance to the abandoned mine is dark and foreboding. Inside, the party finds a small, empty storage shed. Within the shed are a bell and two cups placed on a dusty table.

The cups contain a mild poison which is sweet to the smell. Anyone who drinks from them must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they are poisoned for 24 hours.

Ringing the bell will alert Vez'yen, an old drow with pock-marked skin, approximately 600 years old who usually is further into the mine, in his hidden laboratory.

While waiting for Vez'yen, the party is exposed to toxic fumes, as a strong chemical smell seems to permeate the air. Each member must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they take 3d6 poison damage, or half as much on a successful save.

Vez'yen's demeanor is enigmatic and slightly sinister, adding to the tension of the encounter. Despite his mysterious nature, Vez'yen is still a merchant, so he prefers if the party succeeds and becomes his customer.

Vez'yen challenges the party to a test of mind. Each participant must take a shot of a potent poison and make a DC 13 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, they suffer 3d6 psychic damage and are rendered unconscious for six seconds.

### Outcome

- If the party successfully overcomes the challenges, Vez'yen becomes a valuable resource. He can:
  - Provide a variety of common poisons.
  - Identify unknown poisons brought to him.
  - Offer gold for creatures that can produce poison, encouraging the party to hunt specific beasts.

### Additional Notes

- The mine and the surrounding area have additional hidden entrances and escape routes that Vez'yen frequently uses.
- If the party decides to attack Vez'yen, he will quickly slide into a secret trapdoor and go deeper into the mine, releasing a burst of toxic cloud into the mine entrance where the players are. Each player must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they fall unconscious for 2d4 hours; on a success, they take 3d8 poison damage. If they all fall unconscious, Vez'yen will take gold from the party and leave them at the entrance with a note explaining that he took money for the damages. His prices will go up until they complete a task for him.
