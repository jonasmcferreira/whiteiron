# Weather

The campaign of Jhed should focus heavily on weather, emphasizing how taxing on resources and time dealing with the intense and arcane weather can be. The weather changes quickly represented by rolling on a weather table after each short or long rest. A party should be considering how to engage a problem or delay or speed up their plans based on the weather.

Weather in Jhed is an entity and every time that there is a need to travel, or if the chracters stay unsheltered somewhere longer than a few hours, then we must roll on the weather table.
Depending on the roll, different events will happen

## Endure / Shelter (cleanup)

A party can choose to **Endure** a weather effect to keep moving, or **Shelter** to wait for weather to change.
If a party decides to shelter but then there is an event that forces the party to come outside for example of combat encounter then the entry for would take place

**Shelter** in place is a Short Rest while in cover of the weather.
 If you are in shelter and you are attacked you do not complete the short rest.
