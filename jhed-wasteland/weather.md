# Weather

The campaign of Jhed should focus heavily on weather, emphasizing how taxing on resources and time dealing with the intense and arcane weather can be. The weather changes quickly represented by rolling on a weather table after each short or long rest. A party should be considering how to engage a problem or delay or speed up their plans based on the weather.

Weather in Jhed is an entity and every time that there is a need to travel, or if the characters stay unsheltered somewhere longer than a few hours, then we must roll on the weather table.
Depending on the roll, different events will happen

The party will always be choosing to **Endure** or **Shelter** the weather effects

## Endure 

This choice represents the party deciding to continue overland travel in Jhed, assessing the risk and pushing forward

## Shelter

Shelter in place represents the party taking a short rest (8 hours), and waiting for the weather to change. When the Shelter option has negative effects, it usually is representing enduring the weather as shelter is found. The DM can decide that in this particular situation there is no viable shelter, but would advise against this as weather represents large chunks of time passing 8-16 hours, and can easily lead to over punishing conditions

## Format
