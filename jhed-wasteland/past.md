# past Kings of Jhed

Kings whom have tried to conquer Jhed

## Zeltrin "the fool" 4134 years ago

 Minataur King that united the outer regions. History recalls his adventures as a hero bringing peace and prosperity. The riches of Jhed would be the final chapter of his empire

 Though Zeltrin established some fortifications on the continent of Jhed; some that still remain. The entire army that marched through the Jhed Wasteland including himself went missing

 **Revelation:** Zeltrin has a fake burial in the Jhed Wasteland and still lives. He has learned the origin of the oozes and knows returning will simply bring the greater threat the the outer regions

## Osmin, Pretend King, 4112 years ago

Human King, emerged from power vacuum left behind with Zeltrin considered a failure on most fronts, just taking advantage of a crippled system

There are very few ruins of Omsin's journeys to Jhed making his burial difficult to find

**Revelation:** died in Jhed Continent and never made it to the wasteland during a mutany. The harshness of Jhed took the lives of the mutinous. This betrayel cursed the population of Jhed and is the cause of the undead existing here, and Osmin still acts in many undead forms with a twisted mind

## Council of Five, 1901 years ago

The council of Five never controlled the entire Outer Region as Zeltrin, but were very strategic and resourceful with the territories they reigned over. Unquestionably the greatest empire since. 

By forming an alliance of the common interests in the persuits of arcane knowledge they became the most powerful spellcasters to exist. And they were friends, managing to have little dispute between themselves as they all wanted to learn these secrets.  
  
To them Jhed was a fairytale and the stories of Zeltrin and his failed adventure silly a waste of effort. Eventually their studies brought samples of the arcane powers weaved into the very nature of Jhed, so two members were dispatched, they never work alone.

### "Fizra Bubbles" Female Gnome Inventor

A skilled inventor sent to Jhed to create a framework for exploration

### "Iya Dare the Long Whispers of Words" Elf Weather Manipulator

A protigy of weather control accompanying Fizra to understand and harvest the powers of Jhed. But once both stopped responding the rest of the council took matters into their own hand. They would find only nonesense notes refering to "The Great Works"

    - "Evs Subtletongue" Tiefling Sorcerer
    - "Kren" Kobold Warlock
    - "Saint" Asaamar Sorcerer

    - after failed expiditions they journeyed themselves

 **Revelation:** in the attempts of completing "The Great Works" it transformed them into an ooze

## Urz El DeepStone Dragon, 776 years ago

Brutal ego driven dragon of the underempire. Created a massive invasion force to take the surface and planned the point of attack from Jhed, as it could go unnoticed as they build a launching point for the invasion.

Many individuals from the invading force may still exist in Jhed as they gave up fighting the weather, but the Dragon fly into the Wasteland

This is the dragon the Kobolds are drawn to

**Revelation:**

## The Twins Ivis and Aluna 52 years ago

    - an thieve empire finally taking control of the outer regions
    - successful for a time but eventually pushed out
    - last bastion of the Keys and Jhed Continent
    - remaining a smuggling ring in Jhed unable to be fully defeated
    - Then suddenly missing

**Revelation:**


## First Ones - Oozes

Oozes are the remnants of another plane, a plane transformed entirely into a primordial soup. Interaction with this narrative will be through Madness.

If playing through the late arcs of Jhed (lvl 13+), these Oozes need to be removed from the plane to prevent a similar fate. These oozes aren't acting in a way to destroy the plane but simply their existence causes problems
