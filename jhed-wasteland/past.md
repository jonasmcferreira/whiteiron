Kings whom have tried to conquer Jhed

## Zeltrin "the fool" 4134 years ago

 Giant Minotaur King that united the outer regions. History recalls his adventures as a hero bringing peace and prosperity. The riches of Jhed would be the final chapter of his empire

 Though Zeltrin established some fortifications on the continent of Jhed; some that still remain. The entire army that marched through the Jhed Wasteland including himself went missing
 
 Major reason for survival is the inability to be lost as a Minotaur, great tool for player to find one
 
 Zeltrin has not succumb to madness and will aid whoever he can, but is in a constant state of struggle
 
 Architecture from Zeltrin Empire usually built to host both humanoid and giant sized denizens

 **Revelation:** Zeltrin has a fake burial in the Jhed Wasteland and still lives. He has learned the origin of the oozes and knows returning will simply bring the greater threat the the outer regions
 
 T1: UnderRoc Bridge built by Zeltrin's Empire

## Osmin, Pretend King, 4112 years ago

Human King, emerged from power vacuum left behind with Zeltrin considered a failure on most fronts, just taking advantage of a crippled system. Osmin understood his failings and had an expedition to find the remains of Zeltrin's forces

There are very few ruins of Omsin's journeys to Jhed making his burial difficult to find

Osmin's undead form gets more powerful each time he is killed. He can become an ally, and can be put to rest by finding remnants of Zeltrin

**Revelation:** died in Jhed Continent and never made it to the wasteland during a mutany and his body was cannibalized. The harshness of Jhed took the lives of the mutinous. This betrayel cursed the population of Jhed and is the cause of the undead existing here, and Osmin still acts in many undead forms with a twisted mind.

T1: Ghost that is haunting players

## Council of Five, 1901 years ago

 **Revelation:** in the attempts of completing "The Great Works" it transformed them into an ooze

The council of Five never controlled the entire Outer Region as Zeltrin, but were very strategic and resourceful with the territories they reigned over. Unquestionably the greatest empire since.

By forming an alliance of the common interests in the persuits of arcane knowledge they became the most powerful spellcasters to exist. And they were friends, managing to have little dispute between themselves as they all wanted to learn these secrets.  
  
To them Jhed was a fairytale and the stories of Zeltrin and his failed adventure silly a waste of effort. Eventually their studies brought samples of the arcane powers weaved into the very nature of Jhed, so two members were dispatched, they never work alone.

T1: Teleportation Triangles

### "Fizra Bubbles" Female Gnome Inventor

A skilled inventor sent to Jhed to create a framework for exploration

### "Iya Dare the Long Whispers of Words" Elf Weather Manipulator

A protigy of weather control accompanying Fizra to understand and harvest the powers of Jhed. But once both stopped responding the rest of the council took matters into their own hand. They would find only nonesense notes refering to "The Great Works"

### "Evs Subtletongue" Pitch Black Tiefling Teleporter

Frustrated by the two missing council members Evs lead the remaining three and within J'hed mastered the Teleportation Circle ability. This made the task seem plausable, but still failed in the end.

Studied the triangle warpgates and crafted a couple teleportation circles

### "Kren" Kobold Cultist

Kren seemed to surpass the age of most Kobolds and had a thirst for knowledge like no other. Though constantly reading ancient runes and glyphs trying to map this area, was the most Violent of the Council

Rumors that the existing population is the children of Kren, sometimes nicknamed "Kren-kin"

**Revelation:** Kren has nothing to do with the existing Kobolds

### "Saint" Aasimar Spiritualist

The veto power of the group with the ability to divine and scry for the best causes of action. Saint was rumoured to see into the future, making her demise that much more confusing

**Revelation:** Saint is the Noble of J'hed, but has memories are altered and won't leave the area she is in. When Saint reached this the Seat of J'hed the voices of her God became quiet, the land before her is godless

## Urz El DeepStone Dragon, 776 years ago

Brutal ego driven dragon of the underempire. Created a massive invasion force to take the surface and planned the point of attack from Jhed, as it could go unnoticed as they build a launching point for the invasion.

Many individuals from the invading force may still exist in Jhed as they gave up fighting the weather, but the Dragon fly into the Wasteland

This is the dragon the Kobolds are drawn to

**Revelation:** Frozen in a glacier

T1: Odd amount of underdark denizens in J'hed

## The Twins Ivis and Aluna 52 years ago

These twins were identical in visuals and used this to great effect. It wasn't until their downfall that most knew there was two of them. May be possible that the Kobolds new knowledge of traps and sources of their material come from those theiving caravans

T1: Thieves Key and smugglers past is the remnants of this empire

### "Ivis" Male Drow Assassin

Master of Blade
Master of Stealth

Designed the Mega Dungeon for the assassin's smuggling route. This was based off the warp gates, they didn't build them but they used them and mapped them out

An eccentric weapon collector

### "Aluna" Female Drow Assassin

Master of Poison
Master of Disguise

Aluna learned a way to make a great poison, but it would require a substantial amount of her own blood. Ivis blood was suitable, and so she restrained him and bled him. Eventually he broke free killing Aluna, but without having much left in him, he died as well.

    - an thieve empire finally taking control of the outer regions
    - successful for a time but eventually pushed out
    - last bastion of the Keys and Jhed Continent
    - remaining a smuggling ring in Jhed unable to be fully defeated
    - Then suddenly missing

**Revelation:** both of these are eligable for True ressurection


## First Ones - Oozes

Oozes are the remnants of another plane, a plane transformed entirely into a primordial soup. Interaction with this narrative will be through Madness.

If playing through the late arcs of Jhed (lvl 13+), these Oozes need to be removed from the plane to prevent a similar fate. These oozes aren't acting in a way to destroy the plane but simply their existence causes problems
