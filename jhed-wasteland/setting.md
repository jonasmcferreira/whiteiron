# Jhed Wastelands

## Setting

Welcome, brave adventurers, to the Jhed Wastelands! This land stretches endlessly with an expanse of ice, a frozen desert as vast as Antarctica. Here, the cold is your constant companion, and the wind howls with the voices of ancient spirits. The Jhed Wastelands are a realm of stark beauty and hidden peril, where only the strongest survive and the boldest thrive.

Imagine a world where the horizon is an unbroken line of white, where snow and ice dominate the landscape, and the ground beneath your feet is perpetually frozen. Towering glaciers, like ancient titans, loom over the landscape, their jagged peaks piercing the sky. These massive ice formations move imperceptibly, carving out valleys and creating sheer cliffs of ice, constantly reminding you of nature's raw, unyielding power.

Between these icy giants lie vast fields of snow and ice, seemingly endless and uniform, yet treacherous in their own right. The ice fields can be deceptively smooth, hiding deep crevasses that can swallow the unwary traveler whole. In some areas, the wind shapes the snow into dunes, creating a frozen version of a desert's shifting sands. These snow dunes can be several feet high, making travel slow and arduous.

Elsewhere, frost plains stretch out, flat and featureless, their surfaces glittering like fields of diamonds under the pale sunlight. These plains are often scoured by icy winds, making them some of the coldest and most inhospitable parts of the wastelands. Beneath the surface lies the permafrost, a layer of soil that remains frozen year-round. This permafrost can be incredibly thick, extending hundreds of feet below the surface. It prevents most plant life from taking root, contributing to the barren appearance of the wastelands. However, it also conceals hidden hazards—pockets of methane gas that can ignite explosively, and ancient ice that can crack and shift without warning.

Above this frozen landscape, the aurora borealis dances across the night sky, painting it with vivid hues of green, purple, and blue. These northern lights are a breathtaking sight, a beautiful contrast to the bleakness below. Steeped in legend, some say the auroras are the spirits of ancient warriors, guiding travelers with their ethereal light, while others believe they are a manifestation of powerful arcane energies, hinting at the magic that still lingers in the land.

Interspersed throughout the Jhed Wastelands are frozen lakes and icebound rivers, their surfaces hard and unyielding. These bodies of water, locked in ice, are often covered by thick snow, making them difficult to distinguish from the surrounding terrain. Beneath the ice, some lakes still hold liquid water, kept from freezing solid by geothermal heat or arcane phenomena. These hidden reservoirs are vital sources of water for the inhabitants of the wastelands, though accessing them can be perilous.

The soundscape of the Jhed Wastelands is as unique as its visual panorama. The creaking and groaning of shifting ice is a constant background noise, punctuated by the howling wind and the occasional distant roar of a collapsing glacier. In the stillness of the coldest nights, one might hear the faint cracking of the ice underfoot, a subtle yet ominous reminder of the land's inherent dangers.

Hidden among the glaciers and ice fields are remote valleys and ice caves, offering a brief respite from the harsh elements. These natural shelters can be crucial for survival, providing protection from the wind and a place to set up camp. Some of these caves are simple hollows in the ice, while others are intricate networks of tunnels, possibly formed by ancient lava flows or carved out by subterranean rivers. They can be awe-inspiring, with walls of translucent blue ice and ceilings adorned with icicles.

Due to its extreme latitude, the Jhed Wastelands experience prolonged periods of twilight, where the sun barely rises above the horizon, casting a perpetual twilight over the land. This creates an eerie, otherworldly atmosphere, with long shadows and a sky that transitions through shades of deep blue and purple. The lack of clear daylight can be disorienting, making navigation even more challenging and contributing to the land's reputation as an endless, desolate wilderness.

### Not a Globe

The world that J'hed exists is not a globe, the continent is designed that it can be added to other settings but importantly there is an edge of the world (at least one) and it is in J'hed

### Time

The Jhed Wasteland seems broken in time, as dusk shifts to dawn or day to night without transition. No assurance of how long these moments of light or dark last. Even the stary veil appears random hindering navigation making those that risk such a journey unaware of how long they've been gone. But the beasts who roam and the monstrosities that linger the Jhed Wastelands is a hunting ground. Because of this oddity, denizens of J'hed aren't really aware of how old they are, or how much time passes as there is no constant with weather or migration patterns

### Weather Can Be Good, and for Both Sides

In the vast, unpredictable wilderness of Jhed, the weather is more than just a backdrop—it's an ever-present force that shapes the fate of both friend and foe alike. The harsh conditions are not selective; whether you're a weary adventurer or a lurking predator, the elements will have their say. Yet, Jhed's weather is as capricious as it is brutal. While it can bring bone-chilling cold and blinding blizzards, it also has moments of strange benevolence, where even the most dangerous storms can bring unexpected boons.

#### The Dual Nature of Jhed's Weather

The weather in Jhed should be a constant, dynamic element in your campaign, influencing both combat and exploration. It's a living, breathing force that does not distinguish between hero and villain. When a storm rolls in, everyone must contend with it. This creates an environment where both sides might find themselves hindered or helped by the same weather conditions.

**In Combat:**
- **Blizzards:** During a battle, a sudden blizzard might reduce visibility to nearly nothing, forcing both sides to fight blind. This could lead to more cautious, tactical combat where both parties must rely on sound and intuition rather than sight.
- **Icy Winds:** Gale-force winds can make it difficult to maintain footing or aim ranged attacks, affecting both the party and their enemies. The winds might also shift during combat, potentially giving one side an advantage before turning against them moments later.
- **Frozen Ground:** The ground beneath your feet can suddenly freeze over, making movement treacherous for everyone involved. Even a mighty frost giant could slip and fall if not careful, just as a nimble rogue might find their agility tested.

**Out of Combat:**
- **Travel:** On the road, the weather can be a great equalizer. A storm that hinders the party's progress might also slow down pursuing enemies, buying the heroes precious time to escape or prepare.
- **Rest:** Setting up camp in a sheltered spot during a storm can grant both the party and their foes a much-needed respite, leading to an uneasy truce as everyone seeks refuge from the elements.
- **Navigation:** Arcane winds might temporarily clear the skies, allowing for easier navigation or even revealing hidden paths that would otherwise be obscured by the snow. However, these same winds could aid a rival group in finding their way to a key location.

#### Anomalies and Beneficial Arcane Winds

Jhed is not just a land of relentless hardship; it is also a place where magic intertwines with the natural world in unpredictable ways. Sometimes, the very forces that seek to freeze and obscure can turn on a dime, offering a brief respite or even unexpected advantages.

- **Arcane Winds:** These rare and mystical breezes can blow through the land, invigorating those who feel their touch. An arcane wind might temporarily boost the magical abilities of anyone in its path, allowing for more potent spellcasting or quicker recovery of spent resources. However, this boon is shared by all, meaning both the party and their enemies could suddenly find themselves empowered.
  
- **Warm Fronts:** In the midst of an unrelenting cold, a warm front might sweep through, melting ice and snow, and easing the burdens of travel. These fronts are often short-lived, but they provide a welcome break from the frostbite-inducing temperatures. Yet, they also thaw out dangerous creatures that had been dormant, leading to unexpected encounters.

- **Restorative Storms:** While most storms in Jhed are brutal, some carry a strange restorative energy. Those caught in these storms might find their wounds healing faster, or their fatigue lifted, as if the storm itself were breathing life back into them. But be wary—such storms are fickle, and their effects can end just as suddenly as they began.

### Using Weather

As a Dungeon Master, you can use Jhed's weather to create dynamic and unpredictable encounters that challenge your players to think on their feet. Encourage your players to consider the weather not just as an obstacle, but as a tool. They might choose to wait out a storm to gain its benefits, or they could try to lure enemies into an exposed position during a blizzard. The key is to make the weather feel like an integral part of the world, one that is as likely to help as it is to harm.


### Tectonics

Recently Jhed has experienced a few powerful tectonic events, news that doesn't reach the other regions. Clearly something has disturbed these glacial wastes, but also created a new opportunity for uncovered riches and knowledge. Entrances lost to thousand year snow now uncovered, but even more now lurks the lands and seas.

## Map/World Logistics

The known maps of J'hed are horribly incorrect, and part of this adventure will be figuring out what J'hed really looks like, what it holds and what information is shared to the wider world

### Communication

Bringing information about J'hed to the Outer Regions can bring treasure hunters, political rivals, opportunists or a helping hand.

### Path to J'hed

- Two months travel from the closest trade point outside of Jhed to the nearest trade post in Jhed.
- Peninsula and island keys connect to the continent of Jhed.

### J'hed Continent

- Physically akin to Antarctica for placeholder description.
- 4 small villages for trade at the edge of the Continent and Wasteland.
- These towns mark the southernmost settlements in existence.
- The continent is considered lower-level zones.
- Ambitious kings have tried to conquer J'hed and beyond but have all failed.

### J'hed Coast

The coast can be considered the 1-2 day journey from the cliffs of the continent into J'hed. A very lucrative exploration but not the intensity of the rest

### J'hed Bay

J'hed forms a bay with cliffed landmass, and this region though extremely dangerous is protected compared to the Wasteland, there is a cliffed region in the center of the Bay 

### J'hed Wasteland

- This is the "frozen ocean" of exploration and the source of a gold rush.
- Erratic, unstable, and traveling beasts are required for longer distances.
- No maps or known landmarks.
- Seems lost in time (roll if day or night every short rest).
- Blindspots to gods and devils - within the Wasteland, it seems higher entities simply don't see into the wasteland or even believe it exists.
- A chaotic wilderness that doesn't make geological sense.

### Warp Points

To make Jhed the size of a continent and not just have players do 50 sessions of travelling in snow, there are key points that bring players from point A to point B. These will not be directly in towns and a guarded secret. So for example in Overland Travel: Netrus to Durenthal would be more accurately represented by, 2 days from Netrus to a Warp Point, and another 3 days from the Warp Point to Durenthal

These Warp Points will be able to be modified to change where they go to as more is discovered about Jhed

### Overland Travel

Travelling in Jhed is not done in straight lines, so distances are very relative. When travelling you must take into account that the terrain is unmappable, as it is contantly shifting with storms and the nature of ice, plus getting lost and back on track is a common occurrence and skill in Jhed.

|                    | Durenthal | Netrus | Reef Village | Seat of the Noble Jhed | Witch's Nip |
|--------------------|-----------|--------|--------------|------------------------|-------------|
| **Durenthal**      | -         | 5      | 15           | 35                     | 30          |
| **Netrus**         | 5         | -      | 10           | 30                     | 4           |
| **Reef Village**   | 15        | 10     | -            | 20                     | 30          |
| **Seat of the Noble Jhed** | 35 | 30     | 20           | -                      | 50          |
| **Witch's Nip**    | 30        | 4      | 30           | 50                     | -           |

### Key Thieves

- small key of islands is the most direct path to Jhed, these thieves are the last remnants of the Thieves Kings

## The Code of the Snow

    Survive or Perish, survival is the balance between community and sacrifice.
    
    Render not aid if it means the demise of the group. All understand and accept this law.
    
    Kill not thy kin, but the dead have no feelings. Should they perish, their flesh may sustain thee.
    
    Jhed has no memory of who ye were before. Thy past matters not; only thy deeds in Jhed.
    
    Break not thy word; keep all bargains. Trust is sacred.
    
    Once a village elder or leader decrees, there shall be no appeal nor argument. The decision is final.
    
    Hold no grudges, for they serve no purpose. Let bygones be bygones for the sake of survival.
    
    Punishments: Three punishments there be: branded, exiled, and death. The branded shall not enter the villages of Jhed.

## Expansion

- each village in Jhed is sitting on a semi known but untapped potential of resources
- connecting to villages increases the ability to trade
- connecting to outer regions is a greater effort of time and will create a tension of politics
- attempting to expand into Jhed Wasteland fails
- improving defenses is the first goal, each village spends too mcuh resources stopping raiders
- all villages want to help party raid Jhed, making them take the risk
- the frost syndicate comes
