# Jhed Wastelands

## Setting

Welcome, brave adventurers, to the Jhed Wastelands! This land stretches endlessly with an expanse of ice, a frozen desert as vast as Antarctica. Here, the cold is your constant companion, and the wind howls with the voices of ancient spirits. The Jhed Wastelands are a realm of stark beauty and hidden peril, where only the strongest survive and the boldest thrive.

Imagine a world where the horizon is an unbroken line of white, where snow and ice dominate the landscape, and the ground beneath your feet is perpetually frozen. Towering glaciers, like ancient titans, loom over the landscape, their jagged peaks piercing the sky. These massive ice formations move imperceptibly, carving out valleys and creating sheer cliffs of ice, constantly reminding you of nature's raw, unyielding power.

Between these icy giants lie vast fields of snow and ice, seemingly endless and uniform, yet treacherous in their own right. The ice fields can be deceptively smooth, hiding deep crevasses that can swallow the unwary traveler whole. In some areas, the wind shapes the snow into dunes, creating a frozen version of a desert's shifting sands. These snow dunes can be several feet high, making travel slow and arduous.

Elsewhere, frost plains stretch out, flat and featureless, their surfaces glittering like fields of diamonds under the pale sunlight. These plains are often scoured by icy winds, making them some of the coldest and most inhospitable parts of the wastelands. Beneath the surface lies the permafrost, a layer of soil that remains frozen year-round. This permafrost can be incredibly thick, extending hundreds of feet below the surface. It prevents most plant life from taking root, contributing to the barren appearance of the wastelands. However, it also conceals hidden hazardsâ€”pockets of methane gas that can ignite explosively, and ancient ice that can crack and shift without warning.

Above this frozen landscape, the aurora borealis dances across the night sky, painting it with vivid hues of green, purple, and blue. These northern lights are a breathtaking sight, a beautiful contrast to the bleakness below. Steeped in legend, some say the auroras are the spirits of ancient warriors, guiding travelers with their ethereal light, while others believe they are a manifestation of powerful arcane energies, hinting at the magic that still lingers in the land.

Interspersed throughout the Jhed Wastelands are frozen lakes and icebound rivers, their surfaces hard and unyielding. These bodies of water, locked in ice, are often covered by thick snow, making them difficult to distinguish from the surrounding terrain. Beneath the ice, some lakes still hold liquid water, kept from freezing solid by geothermal heat or arcane phenomena. These hidden reservoirs are vital sources of water for the inhabitants of the wastelands, though accessing them can be perilous.

The soundscape of the Jhed Wastelands is as unique as its visual panorama. The creaking and groaning of shifting ice is a constant background noise, punctuated by the howling wind and the occasional distant roar of a collapsing glacier. In the stillness of the coldest nights, one might hear the faint cracking of the ice underfoot, a subtle yet ominous reminder of the land's inherent dangers.

Hidden among the glaciers and ice fields are remote valleys and ice caves, offering a brief respite from the harsh elements. These natural shelters can be crucial for survival, providing protection from the wind and a place to set up camp. Some of these caves are simple hollows in the ice, while others are intricate networks of tunnels, possibly formed by ancient lava flows or carved out by subterranean rivers. They can be awe-inspiring, with walls of translucent blue ice and ceilings adorned with icicles.

Due to its extreme latitude, the Jhed Wastelands experience prolonged periods of twilight, where the sun barely rises above the horizon, casting a perpetual twilight over the land. This creates an eerie, otherworldly atmosphere, with long shadows and a sky that transitions through shades of deep blue and purple. The lack of clear daylight can be disorienting, making navigation even more challenging and contributing to the land's reputation as an endless, desolate wilderness.

### Day/Night and Time

The Jhed Wasteland seems broken in time, as dusk shifts to dawn or day to night without transition. No assurance of how long these moments of light or dark last. Even the stary veil appears random hindering navigation making those that risk such a journey unaware of how long they've been gone. But the beasts who roam and the monstrosities that linger the Jhed Wastelands is a hunting ground.

### Weather can be good, and for both sides

The weather in Jhed should always be effecting both sides of combat, and there will be benificial arcane winds.

### Tectonics

Recently Jhed has experienced a few powerful tectonic events, news that doesn't reach the other regions. Clearly something has disturbed these glacial wastes, but also created a new opportunity for uncovered riches and knowledge. Entrances lost to thousand year snow now uncovered, but even more now lurks the lands and seas.

## Map/World Logistics

### Path to J'hed

- Two months travel from the closest trade point outside of Jhed to the nearest trade post in Jhed.
- Peninsula and island keys connect to the continent of Jhed.

### J'hed Continent

- Physically akin to Antarctica for placeholder description.
- 4 small villages for trade at the edge of the Continent and Wasteland.
- These towns mark the southernmost settlements in existence.
- The continent is considered lower-level zones.
- Ambitious kings have tried to conquer J'hed and beyond but have all failed.

### J'hed Wasteland

- This is the "frozen ocean" of exploration and the source of a gold rush.
- Erratic, unstable, and traveling beasts are required for longer distances.
- No maps or known landmarks.
- Seems lost in time (roll if day or night every short rest).
- Blindspots to gods and devils - within the Wasteland, it seems higher entities simply don't see into the wasteland or even believe it exists.
- A chaotic wilderness that doesn't make geological sense.

### Overland Travel

Travelling in Jhed is not done in straight lines, so distances are very relative. When travelling you must take into account that the terrain is unmappable, as it is contantly shifting with storms and the nature of ice, plus getting lost and back on track is a common occurrence and skill in Jhed.

### Key of Thieves

- small key of islands is the most direct path to Jhed, these thieves are the last remnants of the Thieve Kings

## The Code of the Snow

    Survive or Perish, survival is the balance between community and sacrifice.
    
    Render not aid if it means the demise of the group. All understand and accept this law.
    
    Kill not thy kin, but the dead have no feelings. Should they perish, their flesh may sustain thee.
    
    Jhed has no memory of who ye were before. Thy past matters not; only thy deeds in Jhed.
    
    Break not thy word; keep all bargains. Trust is sacred.
    
    Once a village elder or leader decrees, there shall be no appeal nor argument. The decision is final.
    
    Hold no grudges, for they serve no purpose. Let bygones be bygones for the sake of survival.
    
    Punishments: Three punishments there be: branded, exiled, and death. The branded shall not enter the villages of Jhed.

## Expansion

- each village in Jhed is sitting on a semi known but untapped potential of resources
- connecting to villages increases the ability to trade
- connecting to outer regions is a greater effort of time and will create a tension of politics
- attempting to expand into Jhed Wasteland fails
- improving defenses is the first goal, each village spends too mcuh resources stopping raiders
- all villages want to help party raid Jhed, making them take the risk
- the frost syndicate comes
