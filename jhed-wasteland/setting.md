# Jhed Wastelands

## Setting

Welcome, brave adventurers, to the Jhed Wastelands! This land stretches endlessly with an expanse of ice, a frozen desert as vast as Antarctica. Here, the cold is your constant companion, and the wind howls with the voices of ancient spirits. The Jhed Wastelands are a realm of stark beauty and hidden peril, where only the strongest survive and the boldest thrive.

Imagine a world where the horizon is an unbroken line of white, where snow and ice dominate the landscape, and the ground beneath your feet is perpetually frozen. Towering glaciers, like ancient titans, loom over the landscape, their jagged peaks piercing the sky. These massive ice formations move imperceptibly, carving out valleys and creating sheer cliffs of ice, constantly reminding you of nature's raw, unyielding power.

Between these icy giants lie vast fields of snow and ice, seemingly endless and uniform, yet treacherous in their own right. The ice fields can be deceptively smooth, hiding deep crevasses that can swallow the unwary traveler whole. In some areas, the wind shapes the snow into dunes, creating a frozen version of a desert's shifting sands. These snow dunes can be several feet high, making travel slow and arduous.

Elsewhere, frost plains stretch out, flat and featureless, their surfaces glittering like fields of diamonds under the pale sunlight. These plains are often scoured by icy winds, making them some of the coldest and most inhospitable parts of the wastelands. Beneath the surface lies the permafrost, a layer of soil that remains frozen year-round. This permafrost can be incredibly thick, extending hundreds of feet below the surface. It prevents most plant life from taking root, contributing to the barren appearance of the wastelands. However, it also conceals hidden hazards—pockets of methane gas that can ignite explosively, and ancient ice that can crack and shift without warning.

Above this frozen landscape, the aurora borealis dances across the night sky, painting it with vivid hues of green, purple, and blue. These northern lights are a breathtaking sight, a beautiful contrast to the bleakness below. Steeped in legend, some say the auroras are the spirits of ancient warriors, guiding travelers with their ethereal light, while others believe they are a manifestation of powerful arcane energies, hinting at the magic that still lingers in the land.

Interspersed throughout the Jhed Wastelands are frozen lakes and icebound rivers, their surfaces hard and unyielding. These bodies of water, locked in ice, are often covered by thick snow, making them difficult to distinguish from the surrounding terrain. Beneath the ice, some lakes still hold liquid water, kept from freezing solid by geothermal heat or arcane phenomena. These hidden reservoirs are vital sources of water for the inhabitants of the wastelands, though accessing them can be perilous.

The soundscape of the Jhed Wastelands is as unique as its visual panorama. The creaking and groaning of shifting ice is a constant background noise, punctuated by the howling wind and the occasional distant roar of a collapsing glacier. In the stillness of the coldest nights, one might hear the faint cracking of the ice underfoot, a subtle yet ominous reminder of the land's inherent dangers.

Hidden among the glaciers and ice fields are remote valleys and ice caves, offering a brief respite from the harsh elements. These natural shelters can be crucial for survival, providing protection from the wind and a place to set up camp. Some of these caves are simple hollows in the ice, while others are intricate networks of tunnels, possibly formed by ancient lava flows or carved out by subterranean rivers. They can be awe-inspiring, with walls of translucent blue ice and ceilings adorned with icicles.

Due to its extreme latitude, the Jhed Wastelands experience prolonged periods of twilight, where the sun barely rises above the horizon, casting a perpetual twilight over the land. This creates an eerie, otherworldly atmosphere, with long shadows and a sky that transitions through shades of deep blue and purple. The lack of clear daylight can be disorienting, making navigation even more challenging and contributing to the land's reputation as an endless, desolate wilderness.

### Unexplored and Not a Globe (player handout)

The universe that J'hed exists in is not a globe, there are many postulations but as J'hed is unmapped it remains heated debate. Navigation guilds would pay a huge sum to answer some of these questions but the proof is harder to obtain. Maps of J'hed are inaccurate and fabrications of fantasy, trinkets to bolster a charlatan's story or fleece a misguided trader. But a true map of J'hed would be a treasure; consider this a potential ambition of your character to venture or explore where few have been and push even further into these hostile lands.

### Time (player handout)

The campaign of J'hed uses the Gritty Realism optional ruleset (Short Rest 8 hours, Long Rest 7 days). One of the design goals this accomplishes is to make a much longer period of time unfold during the adventure. Keep in mind this means that a Standard Adventuring Day more means events that happen over a week, rather than everything happening all in the same day. Another element of gameplay this emboldens is hunting, No longer a night and your quarry is fully restored.

### Time (DM only)

In universe J'hed seems broken in time, as dusk shifts to dawn or day to night without transition. No assurance of how long these moments of light or dark last. Even the stary veil appears random hindering navigation. The beasts and denizens whom roam, the monstrosities that linger in J'hed are unphased by this oddity. This constant fluxuation of time makes it difficult to know how long anyone has been in J'hed to the frustration of Thieves Key and the Outer Empire

### Weather (player handout)

In the vast, unpredictable wilderness of Jhed, the weather is more than just a backdrop—it's an ever-present force that shapes the fate of both friend and foe alike. The harsh conditions are not selective; whether you're a weary adventurer or a lurking predator, the elements will have their say. Yet, J'hed's weather is as capricious as it is brutal. While it can bring bone-chilling winds and blinding blizzards, it also has moments of strange benevolence, where even the most dangerous storms can bring unexpected boons. 

The Outer Empire has had rumors for some time, that the weather of J'hed combines natural and arcane forces but the source or cause is unclear. Consider a character curious to arcane secrets, maybe a desire to harness this wild force, even a nature focused hermit wanting to soothe or understand this disturbance of harmony

### Weather (DM)

Wind, snow, thunder, lightning, magical effects, tremors

### J'hed

Consists of 

#### J'hed Mainland

- Physically akin to Antarctica for placeholder description.
- 4 small villages Netrus, Dhuren'Tol, Oravilla, Seat of J'hed

#### J'hed Coast

The coast can be considered the 1-2 day journey from the cliffs of the continent into J'hed. A very lucrative exploration but dangerous

#### J'hed Bay and Wasteland

For another book

### Locations  

#### Netrus

The majority of this adventure is expected to be taken in Netrus

#### UnderRoc Bridge

Fortification between Netrus and Thieves Key

Zeltrin Empire, built and the smuggling route simply took advantage of its continued existence

#### Thieves Key

Cutthroat town, and compition of Outer Empire

#### Southpost - Outer Empire

- Southport is two weeks away from next Outer Empire trade post
- Peninsula and island keys connect to the continent of J'hed.
- The Outer Empire is intentionally left vague, and players should not be encouraged to visit Southpost. The Outer Empire is everything beyond the scope of J'hed and Thieves Key. It is not one kingdom, but the political mess of the outside world, but Southpost can be convinced to destroy the Thieves Key and begin to take rule over J'hed

## Magic

### People with Magic (player handout)

Though J'hed seems infused with magic, the Outer Region is limited. Casters with the ability of Cantrips can be found in most towns, but leveled spells are rare and beyond level two spells are only heard of by The Council Five.

### Magic Items

Fabricating common magic items is possible, however anything uncommon or greater are "unique". This means that their is only one on the entire plane. Bringing an magic item from another plane to this one causes the new one to fade from existence. These items are imbued uniquely from the weave thus become items of lore and legend

### Overland Travel

Travelling in Jhed is not done in straight lines, so distances are very relative. When travelling you must take into account that the terrain is unmappable, as it is contantly shifting with storms and the nature of ice, plus getting lost and back on track is a common occurrence and skill in Jhed.
