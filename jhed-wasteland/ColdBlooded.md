## Cold Blooded Beasts

### Odd Inhabitants

- Kobolds
- Lizardfolk
- Yuan-ti
- Giant Snakes
- Dinosaurs
- Dragonborn (not unusual)
- Dragons???
- Naga
- Tortle

### Plot Hooks & Revelations

- It should be made obvious that this isn't normal.
- A local fruit (rare) grants cold resistance when consumed over long periods of time. It is a potion reagent.
- Kobolds venture to find a dragon (there have been no dragon sightings in known history).
- Yuan-ti pilgrimage to a great truth, but Naga prevent this.
- Lizardfolk attempt to hunt and tame the Dinosaurs.

### Design Purpose

- Cold-blooded creatures should make this environment feel odd and stand out from a typical arctic setting.
- Tie in a local important flora (fruit that needs a name). Think of these plants as oases within a desert, useful for potion crafting too.
- All the creatures are looking for something in the wasteland, which there are no records of existing.
