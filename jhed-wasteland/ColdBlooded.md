## Cold Blooded Beasts

### Odd Habitants

- Kobolds
- Lizardfolk 
- Yuan-ti
- Giant Snakes
- Dinosaurs
- Dragonborn (not unusual)
- Dragons???
- Naga

### Plot Hooks Revelations

- should be made obvious that this isn't normal
- local fruit (rare) grants cold resistance when consumed over long periods of time. Potion Reagent
- Kobolds venture to find a dragon (there have been no dragon sightings in known history)
- Yuan-ti Pilgrimage to a great truth, but Naga prevent this
- Lizardfolk attempt to hunt and tame the Dinosaurs

### design purpose

- cold blooded creatures should make this enviroment feel odd and stand out from a typical arctic setting
- tie in a local important flora (fruit that needs a name), think of these plants as oasis within a desert, potion crafting too
- all the creatures are looking for something in the waste, that there are no records of existing
