# Story Hooks

## Mysteries of the Arcane Wasteland

- **Ancient Artifacts**: Players can search for powerful artifacts from a lost civilization that could change the balance of power or weather.
- **Frozen Guardians**: Uncover ancient guardians or creatures trapped in ice, awakening as the players disturb their rest.
- **Arcane Weather Control**: Discover a forgotten magical device or spell that could control the harsh weather, but with great risk.

## Village Quests

- **Supply Missions**: Players might need to escort caravans through dangerous routes or retrieve supplies from wrecked ships.
- **Beast Hunts**: Hunt dangerous creatures that threaten the villages or valuable resources.
- **Rescue Missions**: Save lost villagers or adventurers trapped in the wilderness.

## Curses

- **Lycanthrope**: many attacks from breasts can bestow the curse of lycanthrope
- **Remove Curse**: only two NPCs can remove curses
- **Windego**: eating flesh of any "humanoid" will begin the curse of the Windego
- **Stone Gaze**: Medusa and Serpent creatures of Jhed can curse people to stone

## Kobolds Story Hooks

- **Growing Numbers:** Villagers point out increased Kobold sightings but not increased hostility
- **Aspirtant:** Some Kobolds found with ritual style headdressings
- **Dungeon Delvers:** They are found most often pillaging old empire ruins
- **A Great Dragon:** Chants and whispers of an Ancient Dragon, but no record or sighting of such
- **Trade Partners:** Though hostile in temperment they are negotiable for short term agreements

## Thieves Tunnels

- **Previous Rulers:** a thieves guild (insert name) was the last controller of Jhed Continent
- **Tunnels:** abandoned mega-dungeon with an assortment of abandoned and forgotten loot
- **Missing:** no known reason what happened to this guild, even if thieves were well known
- **Safe:** lower level exploration

## Rocs

These giant hunting birds will give a reason not to fly and reason other empires haven't flown into Jhed. But these Rocs hunt in groups and are immensly powerful foes. Clearing a path will open flying travel to Jhed

The Thieves Key is interested in controlling the Rocs not killing them. Their existence makes the area less desirable and harder to invade, but if they could command them, they would smuggle faster

## Netrus Plot Progressions (lvl)

- **Missing Crew(2-4):** a skilled patrol from the North Western cliffwatch hasn't returned
- **Extra Supplies(2-4):** getting an extra shipment of supplies from Village Two or Three would be appreciated
