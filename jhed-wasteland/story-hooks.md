# Story Hooks
# Mysteries

## The Cold Blooded

Nomadic Yuan-ti with Giant Snakes, Lizardfolk with Dinosaurs, and Kobolds pillage through the lands normally unable to survive these harsh cold climates

## The Villages

Empires have failed, Kings have gone missing, invading armies forgotten yet these four villages remain through everything. Netrus, Dhuren Tol, Oravilla and The Seat of J'hed hold secrets

## Kings of J'hed

5 known empires have made some attempt to establish themselves in J'hed and each of them it was their final act before their Kings went missing

## Unmapped and Warpgates

The distance between villages and travel makes little sense in J'hed making it unmapped. Warpgates are scattered making travel passable, but little is known of them or even that people use them as they travel

  
## Ancient Artifacts

Artifacts older than even the Kings of J'hed

## Revelations of J'hed

There is a madness that permiates through the denizens of J'hed and if cured they will reveal new details of what J'hed really is

## Oozes

Too many oozes, a fragment of an ancient past The First Ones and a source of the madness and concentrated power of J'hed

## Other Explorers and Factions

These will combine with assisting and hindering your progression. Some factions and Explorers will complete or fail the tasks you didn't take. The world isn't paused without you, but their goals their true goals may not match the players interests

## Curses

- **Lycanthrope**: many attacks from breasts can bestow the curse of lycanthrope
- **Remove Curse**: only two NPCs can remove curses Whitescale and Sammul
- **Windego**: eating flesh of any "humanoid" will begin the curse of the Windego
- **Stone Gaze**: Medusa and Serpent creatures of Jhed can curse people to stone

## Kobolds Story Hooks

- **Growing Numbers:** Villagers point out increased Kobold sightings but not increased hostility
- **Aspirtant:** Some Kobolds found with ritual style headdressings
- **Dungeon Delvers:** They are found most often pillaging old empire ruins
- **A Great Dragon:** Chants and whispers of an Ancient Dragon, but no record or sighting of such
- **Trade Partners:** Though hostile in temperment they are negotiable for short term agreements

## Thieves Tunnels

- **Previous Rulers:** a thieves guild (insert name) was the last controller of Jhed Continent
- **Tunnels:** abandoned mega-dungeon with an assortment of abandoned and forgotten loot
- **Missing:** no known reason what happened to this guild, even if thieves were well known
- **Safe:** lower level exploration

## Nomads

Kobolds, Lizardfolk and Yuan'ti don't have consistent homes, but large groups of them are sometimes spotted entering into the J'hed Wasteland

## Rocs

These giant hunting birds will give a reason not to fly and reason other empires haven't flown into Jhed. But these Rocs hunt in groups and are immensly powerful foes. Clearing a path will open flying travel to Jhed

The Thieves Key is interested in controlling the Rocs not killing them. Their existence makes the area less desirable and harder to invade, but if they could command them, they would smuggle faster

## Netrus Plot Progressions (lvl)

- **Missing Crew(2-4):** a skilled patrol from the North Western cliffwatch hasn't returned
- **Extra Supplies(2-4):** getting an extra shipment of supplies from Village Two or Three would be appreciated
- **Suspicious Activities(2-4):** Though the village is warded, someone seems to be sneaking in and out randomly
- **Arcane Secrets(2-4):** Sammul belies someone is trying to learn how the glyphs work, maybe to turn them off
- **Oozing Ruins(2-4):** Reagents for better potions East
