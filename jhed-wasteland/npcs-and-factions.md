# Worldfunction Notes on Frostblade Warden

    -Jhed 4 towns probably has a combined population between 60-80 people, when everyone knows everyone renown is meaningless
    -"Ignatius Flameheart Scald of the Inferno Keel" is akin to, Coldus Frosthand Freeze of the Chilly Sails
    -As written can make sense as a smuggling organization bringing stuff in and out of Jhed
    -Strategic brilliance in what capacity, this is a continent defined by unconquerability
    -When mentioning rumored, these notes are not player info cards, what are the facts as well?
    -What does justice in Jhed look like? and does he care about deals that don't relate to him
    -From a visual perspective, the keel would be underwater or ice, if named off visuals it would be steam related as this boat would always be covered in steam. Steam Keel?
    -Fantasy Icebreaker, awesome, whats its crew size if it has cannonballs, once again, Jhed is organized population 80ish
    -The boats magic, is it from the engineering of the boat or something greater
    -A ship with cannons would be too large for Jhed Wasteland both in capacity and function
    -What are actual origins? once again, this is a design doc not a player handout
    -"legendary White Ice Giant Worms" buffed/nerfed  purple wurm? 
    -"fairness and justice" how much of these are guiding principles in an area where survival is difficult
    
    

## Frostblade Wardens and the Inferno Keel

**Name:** Frostblade Wardens   

**Captain:** Captain Ignatius "Flameheart" Scald    

**Ship:** The Inferno Keel    

### Description

**Frostblade Wardens:**

The Frostblade Wardens are a renowned band of vigilantes who sail the icy expanses of the Jhed Wasteland. Known for their unwavering sense of justice and fair dealings, they are hired to transport valuable items, hunt dangerous creatures, and assist those in need—always for a price, which can be paid in goods, gold, or labor. Their reputation for fairness and honor precedes them, and they are respected by the villages they serve.

**Captain Ignatius "Flameheart" Scald:**

Captain Ignatius, known as "Flameheart" for his fiery temper and strategic brilliance, leads the Frostblade Wardens with a firm yet fair hand. He is a charismatic leader with a deep sense of justice, and his rumored connection to fire magic aids in the ship's operations and warmth. He ensures that every deal made is honored and that the Wasteland remains a place where justice can prevail.

**The Inferno Keel:**

The Inferno Keel is a marvel of magical engineering and the pride of the Frostblade Wardens. This ship is unique in its ability to traverse both the open sea and the frozen wastelands, thanks to its enchanted metal hull and keel.

**Hull and Keel:**

The ship's hull is reinforced with a rare, heat-conducting metal that glows faintly with an inner fire. The keel, the ship's backbone, is enchanted with a perpetual **Heat Metal** spell. This magical effect keeps the metal hot enough to melt the ice and snow beneath the ship, allowing it to glide smoothly over frozen surfaces as easily as it sails through water.

**Design and Features:**

- **Flame-touched Sails:** The sails of the Inferno Keel are imbued with fire-resistant enchantments, allowing them to withstand the ship's intense heat. They are often seen glowing with a faint orange hue, especially at night.
- **Frostforged Cannons:** The ship is armed with cannons that shoot both conventional cannonballs and enchanted projectiles designed to shatter ice and create obstacles for pursuing threats.
- **Icebreaker Bow:** The bow of the ship is reinforced to break through thicker ice, making it a formidable vessel in the Arctic waters and frozen plains.

### Lore and Adventures

**Origins:**

The origins of the Inferno Keel are shrouded in mystery. Some say it was forged in the heart of a volcano by a forgotten race of fire giants, while others believe it was the creation of a mad sorcerer who sought to conquer the icy realms. Captain Ignatius Scald discovered the ship and, through unknown means, bound the perpetual Heat Metal spell to its keel.

**Activities:**

The Frostblade Wardens are respected and relied upon across the Jhed Wasteland. They transport heavily valued items between villages, hunt dangerous creatures such as the legendary White Ice Giant Worms, and rescue lost travelers—for a fee. Their services are invaluable, and they ensure that the Wasteland remains a place of fairness and justice.

**Encounters:**

- **Treasure Transport:** The players could hire the Frostblade Wardens to transport a valuable artifact across the wasteland, ensuring its safe delivery.
- **Beast Hunt:** The players join the Frostblade Wardens in a hunt for a White Ice Giant Worm, a dangerous creature threatening the villages.
- **Rescue Mission:** The players are rescued by the Frostblade Wardens after being stranded in a blizzard. They must work off their debt to the Wardens through labor or services.
