## Cold Exposure and Survival Mechanics

In the harsh environment of the Arctic Wastelands, managing your cold levels is crucial for survival. This mechanic will help track cold exposure, manage rations, fuel for camping, and exhaustion levels.

### Cold Exposure Points (CEP)

**CEP System:**
- **Base CEP Gain**: Every hour spent in the wilderness without adequate warmth increases your Cold Exposure Points (CEP) by 1.
- **Severe Weather**: During blizzards or extreme cold conditions, gain an additional 1 CEP per hour.
- **Cold Resistance**: Certain equipment, spells, or abilities can reduce the rate of CEP gain. Each such item or spell can reduce CEP gain by 1 per hour (minimum of 0 CEP per hour).

**CEP Thresholds and Effects:**
- **0-5 CEP**: Comfortable. No adverse effects.
- **6-10 CEP**: Mild Discomfort. Disadvantage on Perception checks.
- **11-15 CEP**: Cold. Disadvantage on all Ability Checks.
- **16-20 CEP**: Severe Cold. Disadvantage on Attack Rolls and Saving Throws.
- **21+ CEP**: Hypothermia. Gain one level of exhaustion every hour.

### Managing CEP

**Reducing CEP:**
- **Rest and Shelter**: Spending an hour in a warm shelter or using a heat source reduces CEP by 1 per hour. Fully resting (long rest) in a warm environment reduces CEP to 0.
- **Warm Clothing**: Special cold-weather gear can reduce the rate of CEP accumulation by 1 per hour.
- **Magical Warmth**: Certain spells (e.g., *Leomund's Tiny Hut*, *Control Temperature*) can provide temporary relief, reducing CEP gain or even eliminating it while active.

**Fuel and Camping:**
- **Fuel for Warmth**: Each hour of maintaining a campfire or similar heat source requires 1 unit of fuel (wood, oil, etc.).
- **Rations**: Each day, adventurers must consume 1 unit of rations to maintain their energy. Missing a day's rations results in 1 level of exhaustion.
- **Shelters**: Tents and magical shelters (like *Leomund's Tiny Hut*) can provide warmth, reducing CEP gain and fuel consumption.

### Exhaustion Levels

Exhaustion caused by cold exposure follows the standard D&D rules:

1. **Level 1**: Disadvantage on Ability Checks.
2. **Level 2**: Speed halved.
3. **Level 3**: Disadvantage on Attack Rolls and Saving Throws.
4. **Level 4**: Hit Point Maximum halved.
5. **Level 5**: Speed reduced to 0.
6. **Level 6**: Death.

**Recovery from Exhaustion:**
- Each level of exhaustion requires one full day of rest in a warm environment and adequate food and water.
- Magical means (such as the *Greater Restoration* spell) can reduce exhaustion levels.

### Example Scenario

- **Hour 1**: The party sets out into the wasteland. Without any additional warmth, each member gains 1 CEP.
- **Hour 2**: A blizzard hits, adding another 1 CEP per hour, so each member gains 2 CEP this hour.
- **Hour 3**: They find a cave to shelter in, setting up a campfire (using 1 unit of fuel per hour). While in the cave, CEP gain is reduced to 0.
- **Resting**: They take a long rest in the cave, reducing CEP to 0 and recovering from any gained CEP.

### Resources Management

- **Tracking Supplies**: Keep a detailed inventory of rations and fuel. Make strategic decisions about when to use resources for warmth or travel.
- **Scavenging**: Players can forage for food and fuel, requiring successful Survival checks. Failed checks may result in no gain and potential CEP increase due to extended exposure.
