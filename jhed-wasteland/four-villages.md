# Four Villages

## Common Features

- All villages have beasts of burden.
- Trade resources among villages and with the greater kingdom.
- Each village has its own focus and unique characteristics.
- Religion plays a significant role in village life.

One way to make NPCs important is to limit overlapping function. If an NPC has a unique ability, is killed or captured, this service is not available in Jhed until the problem is resolved

**Description:**

Welcome to Durenthal, one of the unique border towns of the Jhed Continent. This village, inhabited by around 50 dwarves, exudes an eerie yet bustling atmosphere. As you arrive, the first thing you notice is the constant presence of skeletons patrolling the streets and performing various menial tasks, albeit poorly. Despite the unsettling sight, the town is alive and its inhabitants are well.

The dwarves of Durenthal are resilient and industrious, primarily engaged in mining activities to extract stone and precious gems, which are their main trade resources. The town is known for its excellent quality stone and gems, making it a valuable settlement for obtaining mined materials.

A unique agreement exists in Durenthal: whenever a resident dies or reaches the end of their life, they are offered the chance to be converted into an undead worker, a practice regarded with honor and respect. These undead workers are called **The Volunteers** by the townsfolk, a title that reflects both reverence and practicality.

The constant patrolling and laboring of these Volunteers contribute to the town's smooth functioning. However, it is obvious to any observer that a necromancer is present in the village, though their identity remains a mystery. The inhabitants understand that uncovering and eliminating the necromancer would be detrimental, as the undead workers kept underground would turn on the town. Thus, the necromancer's presence is tacitly accepted, and the town continues to run efficiently under this dark yet effective system.
