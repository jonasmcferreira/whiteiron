# Four Villages

## Common Features

- All villages have beasts of burden.
- Trade resources among villages and with the greater kingdom.
- Each village has its own focus and unique characteristics.
- Religion plays a significant role in village life.

One way to make NPCs important is to limit overlapping function. If an NPC has a unique ability, is killed or captured, this service is not available in Jhed until the problem is resolved

## Netrus - Village One

Breaking the snowdrift is a constant plume of smoke, a village teetering at the cliffs to overlook the Jhed Wasteland. On the left, a lonely stone spire jutting towards the expanse. The rest, a collection of dark wooden longhouses flickering a dim glow of business and respite. The closest structure, a modest two story watch tower signalling your presence has been noticed. At closer inspection, it almost comes across as an ampitheatre with glyphed stonework bordering this break of wilderness. 


## NPCs - Population 20

### "Nick" Ugris, Head of Netrus 

**Stats**: Hill Giant/Storm Giant, **Language**: Giant **Goal**: Keep Netrus Safe, **Weakness**: Rules only by force

Often found outside, "Giant Home" the spire in Netrus to overlook the wasteland and village. A scraggly Giant covered in whisping white hairs from all parts of his body, at a glance almost looking like a yeti. Lumbering around, fishing and sharing stories. 

Nick does not interfere until he is asked with village disputes, but his decisions aren't questioned. The first time someone may act against Netrus he will simply warn the offender, next is exile and the hospitality of Netrus is gone. Any other acts against Netrus will make Nick hostile

Nick will not leave the village for more than a few hours, believing Netrus will be attacked if it loses his protection (he is right)


**Special Rewards**: Hill Giant Belt, and the ability to improve it up qualities

**Revelation**: Nick Ugris is under a madness making him more socialable and desiring to protect Netrus, while making him act more as a Hill Giant, if his Madness is removed he will return to a home in the clouds above Jhed 

### Three Sisters - Ulga Elga Alga - Potion Makers

    Ulga, Elga, Ylga 
    
**Stats**: Green Hag/Night Hag/Sea Hag, **Language**: Giant **Goal**: Aid those loyal to Netrus, **Weakness**: They are together, and if any goes missing they can't function

Ulga speaks of tragedy, stories and wanting to know the struggles the travelers have seen. Appears as a young extremely attractive woman.

Elga speaks of dreams and visions, curious to know what ethereal images travelers have seen. Appears as a middle aged extremely attractive woman

Ylga speaks of beauty and ugliness, wanting to know what everyone finds precious or ugly. Appears as an ugly young woman

If any of the three are removed or killed, they will give the party a quest to find another Potion brewer (hag), if two go missing and die the final one will flee

**Potions**: Once per long rest the party will given 1 potion before they head out if they don't have one (they do this for the entire village)

**Upgrade**: Town size must increase to get increase in potion power (more adventurers), Frostberries and Oozes are important reagents for making new potion types

**Revelation**: Hags Coven, that will begin poisoning everyone if their madness is cured, and then leave. They are aware they are hags.

### Sammul - faith

**Stats**: priest, **Language**:  **Goal**: Deepen the faith of any wanderer, **Weakness**: Curious to Gods that easily corrupt

Sammul has runes etched to his shell and spends his time talking and guiding anyone through a crisis of faith or identity. Often he is the first chosen to handle disputes before it gets to Nick. 

Sammul has the ability to **remove curse**; the party can learn this as he tends to a statue of a petrified adventurer

Each day something of value is thrown off the cliff as a sacrifice to the gods

**Revelation**: Is a cultist, group a now forgotten group that was trying to use Jhed to summon the demon lord Jubilex. He will get the party to help him do this if his madness is removed

### Founding Reasons

    - Northmost tradepost in the Jhed Continent
    - Thief Twin Kings created underground smuggling route from Thieves Key to Netrus
    - Water around Netrus contain intense arcane traces, perfect potion brewing

### Oddities

    - stone's/glyphs of warding everywhere in Netrus
    - charmed when entering, assumed to be from a glyph, hidden truth: relic village is built over
    - fighting arena for disputes/fun/gambling outside of charmed region

### Beasts of Burden info

    - glacial bears, arctic wolves, sabertooths, Vegetarian animal?


### Law

    - Village Four has a noble seat and only desires taxes, the amount is never set.
    - Most disputes are settled through Sammul, else Nick is the final decision
    - The denizens of Netrus don't care about affairs outside of Netrus that don't directly involve them
    - Outside of outward hostility, and theft Netrus only cares about protection of the village

### Food

    - fish and meat in abundance

### Allies, Enemies and Neutral

    - The villagers ask nothing of the party while offering potions, food, and lodging at no cost
    - If the party helps through tasks, donations and protection; this improves the quality and value of these offers
    - Acting against Netrus will come as three warnings, the first being a loss of free support, then exile, and then open hostility on the Jhed Continent

### Expansion and Loss

    - If the population of Netrus shrinks below 10, the village risks total failure and needs the parties help
    - Securing the trade route to the Keys is the best way to expand the population of Jhed while sending out valuable items to begin a gold rush
    - If the village expands it won't all be under the effects of the charm, and Nick won't have enough power to control through force. This will limit potion supply but increase options

## Dhuren Tol

### Three Dwarves - Leader

**Goal**: To make Dhuran Tol the center of the empire of J'hed

One to mine, one to smelt, one to craft

Mountain Dwarf - miner (cursed Pickaxe)

Hill Dwarf - smelter (cursed hand crucible)
  
Grey Dwarf - crafter (cursed hammer)

These three balance their talents with an army of "volunteers" undead to create a surprisingly functional metalworks of Jhed. Coin talks, and they will gladly assist the party of they want to grow Dhuren Tol

**Revelation**: Their crafting tools are cursed, they do not sleep and work perpetually. Removing these will change their greed of coin into power and they will invade the other villages and create their empire by force (and kill each other).

### Fizwidget - gnome inventor, crafter of The Gliding Cloud

Fizwidget just wants to tinker and create, will create things on her own but can be inspired to a specific direction. Fizwidget is the only person that can craft a magic item, but doesn't know the process, simply an inspiration comes

**Description:**

Welcome to Durenthal, one of the unique border towns of the Jhed Continent. This village, inhabited by around 50 dwarves, exudes an eerie yet bustling atmosphere. As you arrive, the first thing you notice is the constant presence of skeletons patrolling the streets and performing various menial tasks, albeit poorly. Despite the unsettling sight, the town is alive and its inhabitants are well.

The dwarves of Durenthal are resilient and industrious, primarily engaged in mining activities to extract stone and precious gems, which are their main trade resources. The town is known for its excellent quality stone and gems, making it a valuable settlement for obtaining mined materials.

A unique agreement exists in Durenthal: whenever a resident dies or reaches the end of their life, they are offered the chance to be converted into an undead worker, a practice regarded with honor and respect. These undead workers are called **The Volunteers** by the townsfolk, a title that reflects both reverence and practicality.

The constant patrolling and laboring of these Volunteers contribute to the town's smooth functioning. However, it is obvious to any observer that a necromancer is present in the village, though their identity remains a mystery. The inhabitants understand that uncovering and eliminating the necromancer would be detrimental, as the undead workers kept underground would turn on the town. Thus, the necromancer's presence is tacitly accepted, and the town continues to run efficiently under this dark yet effective system.
